7975-280076-0005 IT WAS CHARGED THAT ARTHUR MC COY OR A C MC COY AND MYSELF HAD BEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE GAD'S HILL AFFAIR AND THE TWO STAGE ROBBERIES
7975-280076-0028 IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADAIR IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY
7975-280076-0027 I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THAT TIME I WAS AT NEOSHO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
7975-280076-0018 WE CROSSED ON THE BRIDGE STAYED IN THE CITY ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING WE RODE UP THROUGH THE CITY
7975-280076-0008 I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0023 THERE WERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED PERSONS THERE WHO WILL TESTIFY IN ANY COURT THAT JOHN AND I WERE THERE
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0003 NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280076-0011 I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS THAT FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY
7975-280076-0012 I THEN WENT TO ARKANSAS AND RETURNED TO SAINT CLAIR COUNTY ABOUT THE FIRST OF MAY
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARKLEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7975-280076-0004 JUNE THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE OBOCOCK BROTHERS BANK AT CORYDON IOWA WAS ROBBED OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY SEVEN MEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
7975-280076-0000 ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0017 OUR BUSINESS THERE WAS TO SEE E P WEST HE WAS NOT AT HOME BUT THE FAMILY WILL REMEMBER THAT WE WERE THERE
7975-280076-0021 POOR JOHN HE HAS BEEN HUNTED DOWN AND SHOT LIKE A WILD BEAST AND NEVER WAS A BOY MORE INNOCENT
7975-280076-0020 WE WERE NOT ON GOOD TERMS AT THE TIME NOR HAVE WE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS OLL SHEPHERD RED MONKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRELL
7975-280076-0024 HELVIN FICKLE AND WIFE OF GREENTON VALLEY WERE ATTENDING THE SPRINGS AT THAT TIME AND EITHER OF THEM WILL TESTIFY TO THE ABOVE FOR JOHN AND I SAT IN FRONT OF MISTER SMITH WHILE HE WAS PREACHING AND WAS IN HIS COMPANY FOR A FEW MOMENTS TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE AND MISTER AND MISSUS FICKLE AFTER SERVICE
7975-280076-0002 THIS RAID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY BLOODSHED JUDGE MC LAIN THE BANKER BEING SHOT THOUGH NOT FATALLY
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLATIN BANK ROBBERY I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEAS TAYLOR AND RECTOR
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH IT PILLOWED ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0006 THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280085-0015 ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
7975-280085-0009 WE WERE IN SIGHT OF OUR LONG SOUGHT HORSES WHEN THEY CUT US OFF FROM THE ANIMALS AND OUR LAST HOPE WAS GONE
7975-280085-0018 AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
7975-280085-0008 BUT THEY SOON AFTER GOT CLOSE ENOUGH SO THAT ONE OF THEM BROKE MY WALKING STICK WITH A SHOT
7975-280085-0011 FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED
7975-280085-0005 NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POSTHASTE INTO MANKATO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
7975-280085-0002 BOB'S SHATTERED ELBOW WAS REQUIRING FREQUENT ATTENTION AND THAT NIGHT WE MADE ONLY NINE MILES AND MONDAY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WE SPENT IN A DESERTED FARM HOUSE CLOSE TO MANKATO
7975-280085-0016 SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATONWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
7975-280085-0013 THERE IS NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPPED TO THE FRONT SHERIFF GLISPIN COLONEL T L VOUGHT B M RICE G A BRADFORD C A POMEROY AND S J SEVERSON
7975-280085-0004 FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARD WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280084-0003 J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
7975-280084-0014 AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0005 AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
7975-280084-0010 EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280084-0011 DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280084-0001 WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
7975-280084-0007 CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL PITTS CHASED HIM WITH A BULLET
7975-280084-0002 WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
7975-280063-0001 BOONE MUIR AND MYSELF MET COFFEE AND THE REST BELOW ROSE HILL ON GRAND RIVER
7975-280063-0010 I WAS TOLD BY SOME OF OUR MEN FROM THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE STATE THAT THEY RECOGNIZED THE DARING YOUNG RIDER AS COLE YOUNGER
7975-280063-0000 WE TOOK THE OATH PERHAPS THREE HUNDRED OF US DOWN ON LUTHER MASON'S FARM A FEW MILES FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE WHERE COLONEL HAYS HAD ENCAMPED AFTER INDEPENDENCE
7975-280063-0006 JACKMAN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280063-0005 I THINK HE'LL BE RATHER TOUGH MEAT FOR BREAKFAST I REPLIED HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
7975-280063-0003 FOSTER HAD NEARLY ONE THOUSAND CAVALRYMEN AND TWO PIECES OF RABB'S INDIANA BATTERY THAT HAD ALREADY MADE FOR ITSELF A NAME FOR HARD FIGHTING
7975-280063-0002 ACCORDINGLY I WAS SHORTLY AWAKENED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LONE JACK WHERE HE WOULD PERSONALLY MAKE KNOWN THE SITUATION TO THE OTHER COLONELS
7975-280057-0000 THESE HATREDS WERE SOON TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR ME OF WHICH I HAD NEVER DREAMED
7975-280057-0006 MY FATHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILES
7975-280057-0007 HE HAD STARTED BACK TO HARRISONVILLE IN A BUGGY BUT WAS WAYLAID ONE MILE SOUTH OF WESTPORT A SUBURB OF KANSAS CITY AND BRUTALLY MURDERED FALLING OUT OF HIS BUGGY INTO THE ROAD WITH THREE MORTAL BULLET WOUNDS
7975-280057-0014 BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORT SHE SOUGHT FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280057-0012 NOW OLD LADY CALL ON YOUR PROTECTORS WHY DON'T YOU CALL ON COLE YOUNGER NOW
7975-280057-0018 ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LEXINGTON WEEKLY
7975-280057-0008 MISSUS WASHINGTON WELLS AND HER SON SAMUEL ON THE ROAD HOME FROM KANSAS CITY TO LEE'S SUMMIT RECOGNIZED THE BODY AS THAT OF MY FATHER
7975-280057-0001 HENRY WASHINGTON YOUNGER MY FATHER REPRESENTED JACKSON COUNTY THREE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS ALSO JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT
7975-280057-0019 ONE OF MY OLD SCHOOL TEACHERS WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE THE SPRING OR SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO IS STEPHEN B ELKINS SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
7975-280057-0009 MISSUS WELLS STAYED TO GUARD THE REMAINS WHILE HER SON CARRIED THE NEWS OF THE MURDER TO COLONEL PEABODY OF THE FEDERAL COMMAND WHO WAS THEN IN CAMP AT KANSAS CITY
7975-280057-0002 MY MOTHER WHO WAS BURSHEBA FRISTOE OF INDEPENDENCE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTOE WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTOE'S INSISTENCE
7975-280057-0016 I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0004 MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
8188-269290-0008 I KNOW YOU DON'T QUITE MEAN WHAT YOU SAY SAID LESLIE BUT OF COURSE IF YOU REALLY WISH ME
8188-269290-0032 SCARCELY LIKELY REPLIED LESLIE SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO COME TO THE MEETING
8188-269290-0021 YOU SEE ALL THE GIRLS EXCEPT EILEEN AND MARJORIE LAUGH AT HER AND THAT SEEMS TO ME TO MAKE HER WORSE
8188-269290-0029 I AM SURE SHE IS ILL SHE WORKS TOO HARD AND SHE BUT THERE I DON'T KNOW THAT I OUGHT TO SAY ANY MORE
8188-269290-0048 AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0033 BUT MARJORIE AND EILEEN HAD ALREADY DEPARTED AND LESLIE AND JANE FOUND THEMSELVES AMONG THE LAST STUDENTS TO ARRIVE AT THE GREAT EAST HALL
8188-269290-0041 THE NAMES OF PROPOSED MEMBERS ARE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ME BEFORE THIS DAY WEEK
8188-269290-0036 THE PHYSICAL PART OF YOUR TRAINING AND ALSO THE MENTAL PART ARE ABUNDANTLY SUPPLIED IN THIS GREAT HOUSE OF LEARNING SHE CONTINUED BUT THE SPIRITUAL PART IT SEEMS TO ME OUGHT NOW TO BE STRENGTHENED
8188-269290-0035 THEN A ROLL CALL WAS GONE THROUGH BY ONE OF THE TUTORS THE ONLY ABSENTEE WAS ANNIE COLCHESTER
8188-269290-0034 MISS LAUDERDALE WAS STANDING WITH THE OTHER TUTORS AND PRINCIPALS OF THE DIFFERENT HALLS ON A RAISED PLATFORM
8188-269290-0001 IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LESLIE RAN UP TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HALL
8188-269290-0004 IT DOESN'T MATTER REPLIED ANNIE WHETHER IT IS AN ORDER OR NOT I'M NOT COMING SAY NOTHING ABOUT ME PLEASE
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LAUDERDALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED HERSELF
8188-269290-0023 IF YOU ARE IN LONDON DURING THE SUMMER YOU MUST COME AND PAY US A VISIT WILL YOU
8188-269290-0052 I SEE BY YOUR FACE MISS GILROY THAT YOU ARE DISTRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING ARE YOU KEEPING ANYTHING BACK
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VANE FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED IT TO PYM WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWN DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOSE SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UP A COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVE LAIN FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICERS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MOUNTNORRIS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS THE MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0007 HOWEVER THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH
8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ARE ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8188-269288-0056 THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
8188-269288-0029 NOW I REMEMBER SHE GOT A LETTER WHICH UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT OUT
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANYONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0043 NOW DRINK THIS AT ONCE SHE SAID IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY IF YOU REALLY WISH TO SLEEP
8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET INTO BED
8188-269288-0014 THESE LETTERS HAVE JUST COME FOR YOU AND ANNIE COLCHESTER SHE SAID AND AS I WAS COMING UPSTAIRS I THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH YOU
8188-269288-0016 HER EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE AT THE ANTICIPATION OF THE DELIGHTFUL TIME SHE WOULD HAVE REVELING IN THE HOME NEWS THE OTHER LETTER WAS DIRECTED TO ANNIE COLCHESTER
8188-269288-0039 I WALKED UP AND DOWN AS FAST AS EVER I COULD OUTSIDE IN ORDER TO MAKE MYSELF SLEEPY
8188-269288-0033 LESLIE LEFT THE ROOM BUT SHE HAD SCARCELY GONE A DOZEN PACES DOWN THE CORRIDOR BEFORE SHE MET ANNIE RETURNING
8188-269288-0034 ANNIE'S EYES WERE VERY BRIGHT HER CHEEKS WERE NO LONGER PALE AND THERE WAS A BRILLIANT COLOR IN THEM
8188-269288-0030 LESLIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER
8188-269288-0002 HER TASTES ALL LAY IN THIS DIRECTION HER IDEA BEING BY AND BY TO FOLLOW HER MOTHER'S PROFESSION OF JOURNALISM FOR WHICH SHE ALREADY SHOWED CONSIDERABLE APTITUDE
8188-269288-0035 SHE DID NOT TAKE THE LEAST NOTICE OF LESLIE BUT GOING INTO THE ROOM SHUT THE DOOR
8188-269288-0031 SHE IS A VERY QUEER ERRATIC CREATURE AND THAT LETTER THERE WAS BAD NEWS IN THAT LETTER
2033-164914-0014 BUT THE EUNUCH SAID I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE TILL THOU SHOW ME WHO IT WAS THAT RECITED THE VERSES FOR I DREAD RETURNING TO MY LADY WITHOUT HIM
2033-164914-0011 BUT TAKE THESE HUNDRED DINERS AND GIVE THEM TO THE SINGER AND BRING HIM TO ME GENTLY AND DO HIM NO HURT
2033-164914-0006 WHAT AILS THEE THEN THAT THOU MUST NEEDS RECITE VERSES SEEING THAT WE ARE TIRED OUT WITH WALKING AND WATCHING AND ALL THE FOLK ARE ASLEEP FOR THEY REQUIRE SLEEP TO REST THEM OF THEIR FATIGUE
2033-164914-0000 REPLIED HE OF A TRUTH I HEARD HIM NOT AND I WOT HIM NOT AND FOLKS ARE ALL SLEEPING
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR WHILOME HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED AT THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE
2033-164914-0019 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH TO ZAU AL MAKAN PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY LORD
2033-164914-0010 BY ALLAH AN THOU FETCH HIM NOT TO ME I WILL ASSUREDLY ROUSE THE CHAMBERLAIN ON THEE AND HE SHALL BEAT THEE AND CAST THEE OUT
2033-164914-0020 O MY LORD CONTINUED THE EUNUCH AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164914-0017 THEN HE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HEAD AND SPAKE HIM FAIR TILL HE WENT AWAY BUT THE CASTRATO FETCHED A ROUND AND RETURNING SECRETLY CAME AND STOOD BEHIND THE FIREMAN FEARING TO GO BACK TO HIS MISTRESS WITHOUT TIDINGS
2033-164914-0002 THEN SAID THE EUNUCH ART THOU HE WHO REPEATED POETRY BUT NOW AND MY LADY HEARD HIM
2033-164914-0016 SO GO THOU TO THY STATION AND IF THOU AGAIN MEET ANY ONE AFTER THIS HOUR RECITING AUGHT OF POETRY WHETHER HE BE NEAR OR FAR IT WILL BE I OR SOME ONE I KNOW AND THOU SHALT NOT LEARN OF HIM BUT BY ME
2033-164914-0015 NOW WHEN THE FIREMAN HEARD THESE WORDS HE FEARED FOR ZAU AL MAKAN AND WEPT WITH EXCEEDING WEEPING AND SAID TO THE EUNUCH BY ALLAH IT WAS NOT I AND I KNOW HIM NOT
2033-164914-0022 THEN THE EUNUCH WENT OUT TO ZAU AL MAKAN AND SAID TO HIM RECITE WHAT VERSES THOU KNOWEST FOR MY LADY IS HERE HARD BY LISTENING TO THEE AND AFTER I WILL ASK THEE OF THY NAME AND THY NATIVE COUNTRY AND THY CONDITION
2033-164914-0021 WE WILL DO THEE NO UPRIGHT O MY SON NOR WRONG THEE IN AUGHT BUT OUR OBJECT IS THAT THOU BEND THY GRACIOUS STEPS WITH ME TO MY MISTRESS TO RECEIVE HER ANSWER AND RETURN IN WEAL AND SAFETY AND THOU SHALT HAVE A HANDSOME PRESENT AS ONE WHO BRINGETH GOOD NEWS
2033-164916-0010 HE THEN REPAIRED TO THE HEART OF THE ENCAMPMENT AND ORDERED THE HOST TO HALT TEN DAYS
2033-164916-0002 WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAIN TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFEL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164916-0003 ZAU AL MAKAN BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THIS POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY AND SET HIM ON THE RIGHT WAY
2033-164916-0008 LASTLY THE MINISTER WENT IN AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE ZAU AL MAKAN WHO ROSE TO MEET HIM SAYING WELCOME O WAZIR AND SIRE SANS PEER
2033-164916-0000 SO HE TURNED TO THE WAZIR DANDAN AND SAID TO HIM VERILY YOUR TALE IS A WONDER OF WONDERS
2033-164916-0001 KNOW O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAU AL MAKAN AND HIS SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164916-0009 MOREOVER THE SULTAN COMMANDED HIS WAZIR DANDAN CALL A TEN DAYS HALT OF THE ARMY THAT HE MIGHT BE PRIVATE WITH HIM AND LEARN FROM HIM HOW AND WHEREFORE HIS FATHER HAD BEEN SLAIN
2033-164916-0005 AFTER AWHILE THE DUST DISPERSED AND THERE APPEARED UNDER IT THE ARMY OF BAGHDAD AND KHORASAN A CONQUERING HOST LIKE THE FULL TIDE SEA AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
2033-164915-0013 AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARRKAN SON OF OMAR BIN AL NU'UMAN LORD OF BAGHDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGHDAD
2033-164915-0002 WHEN THE EUNUCH SAW THIS CASE HE WONDERED AT THEM AND THROWING OVER THEM SOMEWHAT TO COVER THEM WAITED TILL THEY SHOULD RECOVER
2033-164915-0007 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE STOKER GIRTHED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS CHAMBERLAIN TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STOKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRTHING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164915-0009 WHY DIDST THOU SAY I NEVER REPEATED THESE COUPLETS NOR DO I KNOW WHO REPEATED THEM WHEN IT WAS THY COMPANION
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BADAWI HOW THE MERCHANT HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARRKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM HOW HE HAD FREED HER AT THE TIME OF BUYING HOW HE HAD MADE A MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER AND HAD GONE IN TO HER AND HOW THE KING THEIR SIRE HAD SENT AND ASKED FOR HER FROM SHARRKAN
2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAU AL MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIGHS THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR AL HIJAZ AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164915-0010 BUT NOW I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE BETWEEN THIS PLACE AND BAGHDAD AND WHAT BETIDETH THY COMRADE SHALL BETIDE THEE
2033-164915-0016 SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARRKAN AND MAKE HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
2033-164915-0008 I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES ET ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIME
2033-164915-0014 SO FARE YE FORWARDS NO HARM SHALL BEFAL YOU TILL YOU JOIN HIS GRAND WAZIR DANDAN
2033-164915-0001 THEN SHE THREW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HE GATHERED HER TO HIS BOSOM AND THE TWAIN FELL DOWN IN A FAINTING FIT
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0064 BUT HOO'S COME AT LAST AND HOO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HOO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HOO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MILTON
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0084 WHY I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0088 I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
1688-142285-0095 THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O'NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BEULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP HER WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0053 YO'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0092 I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
8131-117016-0004 EVEN DERELICTS AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT THERE WERE STORES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0015 BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MURDOCH'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COP
8131-117016-0006 THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE COPS STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0032 MURDOCH INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0009 GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0013 HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TONIGHT PICK ANY ROUTE THAT'S OPEN OKAY MEN LET'S GO
8131-117016-0040 IN THE THIRD ONE BRUCE GORDON SPOTTED ONE OF THE MEN WHO'D BEEN BEATEN BEFORE
8131-117016-0010 I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0012 THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONEWALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117016-0037 IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0039 MURDOCH SENT ONE OF THE MEN TO PICK UP A SECOND SQUAD OF SIX AND THEN A THIRD
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
8131-117016-0031 IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING A DIM PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED WHEN DARKNESS FELL THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0011 YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERYONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOR BULBS AT THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORIZED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0022 GORDON HAD HEARD OF THE FRIENDLY INTEREST CHARGED ON THE SIDE HERE BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WRONG IZZY
8131-117017-0008 ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORK PAPERS HAD THE TELLTALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THAT HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HALEY'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN IZZY WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USE THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117017-0020 YOU DIDN'T PAY UP YOUR PLEDGE TO THE CAMPAIGN FUND SO I HADDA FILL IN
8131-117017-0031 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED ONTO THE BENCH
8131-117017-0009 SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COP WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
8131-117029-0010 THAT'S MARS GORDON ECHOED THE OTHER'S COMMENT WHY DON'T YOU PULL OFF THE PLANET FATS YOU COULD GO BACK TO EARTH I'D GUESS THE OTHER NODDED
8131-117029-0007 FATS PLACE WAS STILL OPEN THOUGH THE CROOKED TABLES HAD BEEN REMOVED GORDON DROPPED TO A STOOL SLIPPING OFF HIS HELMET
8131-117029-0015 LET'S SAY YOU'VE SHIFTED SOME OF THE MISERY AROUND A BIT AND GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO DO BETTER
8131-117029-0004 GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE THE DOME BUT OPAQUE FOR PRIVACY
8131-117029-0017 THERE'S A ROCKET WAITING TO TRANSSHIP YOU TO THE MOON ON THE WAY TO MERCURY RIGHT NOW GORDON SIGHED
8131-117029-0011 GUESS A MAN GETS USED TO ANYTHING HELL MAYBE I CAN HIRE SOME BUMS TO SIT AROUND AND WHOOP IT UP WHEN THE SHIPS COME IN AND BILL THIS AS A REAL OLD MARTIAN DEN OF SIN
8131-117029-0000 THERE WAS A MAN COMING FROM EARTH ON A SECOND SHIP WHO WOULD SEE HIM
6432-63722-0038 AND DONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0002 I'M GOING OFF FISHING I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING I MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYIN I SEE
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0006 CARROLL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0033 AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0018 AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEADPENCIL
6432-63722-0021 PHUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAST NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNER NAMED SHERE ALI
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0023 NEIGHBORS OFTEN HEARD EM SCRAPPIN A LOT AND THIS AFTERNOON THEY WENT AT IT AGAIN HOT AND HEAVY
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0030 YOU'RE NOT AS SQUEAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HAND AND IN A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA PHUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREEL COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0048 I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RATCHFORD HAD MARRIED
6432-63723-0053 THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
6432-63723-0014 LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0016 NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0054 IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
6432-63723-0052 BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0046 THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AS MANY TOBACCO POUCHES TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITION IN THE REGULATION QUOTED OF SMOKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED IT MAY BE NOTED TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY SAYS MISTER DITCHFIELD HE HAD AN EXTRA PIPE AND JOSHUA THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING IMPATIENT
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DISNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH AT HAYES IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EXCITING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0006 PARR WAS SUCH A CONTINUAL SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HAD NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE
2609-156975-0031 DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES BIRTH AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY
2609-156975-0002 LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET US DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST ANTOLIAN PLAIN IN CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN
2609-156975-0034 THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS THE LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0017 IS PEONAGE ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS BUT ALSO TO THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING IT
2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY INSCRIPTION ALSO STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHUM THE HOUSE OF RAMSES A CITY WITH A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVES
2609-156975-0032 THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES POSSIBLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KEDEM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUB TRIBE OF THE KENITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY P ATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ULTIMATELY COALESCED INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHO IS TURBULENT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KING MERNEPTAH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-169640-0024 IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD ALL HER CANVAS BEING FULL LEAVING THE PROA MOTIONLESS IN HER WAKE
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0011 MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE ONE FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN A BOAT
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH PROAS AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER
2609-169640-0000 PROAS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY SHIPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEA IS FULL OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-169640-0001 AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RATTLING OF THE BOARDING PIKES TOO AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0009 AS OUR SHEETS WERE ALL FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0018 THE QUESTION WAS NOW WHETHER WE COULD PASS THEM OR NOT BEFORE THEY GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO GRAPPLE
2609-169640-0021 ON OUR SIDE WE GAVE THE GENTLEMEN THE FOUR SIXES TWO AT THE NEAREST AND TWO AT THE STERN MOST PROA WHICH WAS STILL NEAR A CABLE'S LENGTH DISTANT
2609-169640-0019 THE CAPTAIN BEHAVED PERFECTLY WELL IN THIS CRITICAL INSTANT COMMANDING A DEAD SILENCE AND THE CLOSEST ATTENTION TO HIS ORDERS
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAST BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS A LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN A LIVELY DANCE
6070-86744-0004 THEN IT IS SETTLED SAID THE COUNT AND I GIVE YOU MY SOLEMN ASSURANCE THAT I ONLY WAITED AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE PRESENT TO REALIZE PLANS THAT I HAVE LONG MEDITATED
6070-86744-0007 I RESIDE IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE BUT OCCUPY A PAVILION AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE COURT YARD ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN BUILDING
6070-86744-0028 WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SIGNOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND UNCONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLOSSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDIT PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YACHT SEEN IN THE DISTANT HORIZON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAIL TOWARD PORTO VECCHIO
6070-86744-0001 MY VERY GOOD FRIEND AND EXCELLENT NEIGHBOR REPLIED THE COUNT WITH A SMILE YOU REALLY EXAGGERATE MY TRIFLING EXERTIONS
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES REPLIED FRANZ OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT WHAT IS HIS NATIVE TONGUE WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN THAT HAVE TINCTURED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY

6070-86744-0008 NOW THEN SAID THE COUNT RETURNING HIS TABLETS TO HIS POCKET MAKE YOURSELF PERFECTLY EASY THE HAND OF YOUR TIME PIECE WILL NOT BE MORE ACCURATE IN MARKING THE TIME THAN MYSELF
6070-86744-0000 FRANZ WHO SEEMED ATTRACTED BY SOME INVISIBLE INFLUENCE TOWARDS THE COUNT IN WHICH TERROR WAS STRANGELY MINGLED FELT AN EXTREME RELUCTANCE TO PERMIT HIS FRIEND TO BE EXPOSED ALONE TO THE SINGULAR FASCINATION THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE SEEMED TO EXERCISE OVER HIM AND THEREFORE MADE NO OBJECTION TO ALBERT'S REQUEST BUT AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE DESIRED SPOT AND AFTER A SHORT DELAY THE COUNT JOINED THEM IN THE SALON
6070-86744-0002 MY FATHER THE COMTE DE MORCERF ALTHOUGH OF SPANISH ORIGIN POSSESSES CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE BOTH AT THE COURT OF FRANCE AND MADRID AND I UNHESITATINGLY PLACE THE BEST SERVICES OF MYSELF AND ALL TO WHOM MY LIFE IS DEAR AT YOUR DISPOSAL
6070-86744-0014 WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED ALBERT OF FRANZ WHEN THEY HAD RETURNED TO THEIR OWN APARTMENTS YOU SEEM MORE THAN COMMONLY THOUGHTFUL
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE

6070-86744-0013 WELL SINCE WE MUST PART SAID THE COUNT HOLDING OUT A HAND TO EACH OF THE YOUNG MEN ALLOW ME TO WISH YOU BOTH A SAFE AND PLEASANT JOURNEY
6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TAPIS FRANC ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPENED CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0000 THEY'RE DONE FOR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TO THE CHOUETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SARAH AND TOM THEY DID NOT HEAR THEM
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT FOR I KNOW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SEYTON WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO THIS HOLE
6070-63485-0014 WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANT AND I SHALL SEE
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT OUEN AND THE ROAD OF LA REVOLTE AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0006 TOM SEYTON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTE I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN A VALET ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE GROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND COURT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHES
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BOURGES IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES SEVEN
6070-86745-0008 YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LUNA
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WORK A DAY ASPECT
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LUNA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASIL RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRDSEYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARY HACK SEEM ALREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0005 ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVED THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FARRINDER WHO LIVED AT ROXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MIST OF EMOTION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6128-63244-0019 THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0015 SAID OLIVE CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0004 OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE JUST REVOLUTION IT MUST TRIUMPH IT MUST SWEEP EVERYTHING BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BLOOD STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0009 CHARLIE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THEY CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0021 THEY WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WEAK INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0014 I LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRENTS MISSUS FARRINDER ADDED IN A TONE AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH A SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINDER SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG UNREWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OR AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0005 NO I M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
3331-159609-0004 TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0010 POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLTALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
3331-159609-0024 FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHAWS
3331-159605-0000 SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PUTTEL INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0002 I VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD N'T THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0019 AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE WILLY AND FLOSSY SAID THE MAID
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH A SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULD N'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHAWS TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BRILLIANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS N'T HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD N'T HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO DON'T THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT SILLY TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIE CLEVERLY
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE AND A WILD LEER IN HIS YELLOW EYES RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE SCAPEGRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN REVELLED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED HIS PACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THAT MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGOT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0009 THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND NATTY WERE THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH HIS BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF HIS CAGE HER PILLOW SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM A TOILET BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0014 LUKE TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGS AND GROOMED MISTER WYLDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOG CART FOR MARK BEING CLOSE ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOG CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LION WHICH HAS ITS GABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN GYLINGDEN
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDEAWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41169-0019 AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0015 IF WE'RE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU'VE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWERBEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASSILIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTEE BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR ORDER A BALLOT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0021 IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JEERED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO NUTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY NYTOUCH SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTESS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOURS SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE IN DYING
4198-12281-0010 TO SOME WITH A SMART SOUSE ON THE EPIGASTER HE WOULD MAKE THEIR MIDRIFF SWAG THEN REDOUBLING THE BLOW GAVE THEM SUCH A HOMEPUSH ON THE NAVEL THAT HE MADE THEIR PUDDINGS TO GUSH OUT
4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANTIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-12281-0007 WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST AND VINTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0009 TO OTHERS AGAIN HE UNJOINTED THE SPONDYLES OR KNUCKLES OF THE NECK DISFIGURED THEIR CHAPS GASHED THEIR FACES MADE THEIR CHEEKS HANG FLAPPING ON THEIR CHIN AND SO SWINGED AND BALAMMED THEM THAT THEY FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM LIKE HAY BEFORE A MOWER
4198-12281-0000 ALTHOUGH THE PLAGUE WAS THERE IN THE MOST PART OF ALL THE HOUSES THEY NEVERTHELESS ENTERED EVERYWHERE THEN PLUNDERED AND CARRIED AWAY ALL THAT WAS WITHIN AND YET FOR ALL THIS NOT ONE OF THEM TOOK ANY HURT WHICH IS A MOST WONDERFUL CASE
4198-12259-0035 I HAVE A REMEDY AGAINST THIRST QUITE CONTRARY TO THAT WHICH IS GOOD AGAINST THE BITING OF A MAD DOG
4198-12259-0032 LET US WIND OUR HORNS BY THE SOUND OF FLAGONS AND BOTTLES AND CRY ALOUD THAT WHOEVER HATH LOST HIS THIRST COME NOT HITHER TO SEEK IT
4198-12259-0004 BY THE BELLY OF SANCT BUFF LET US TALK OF OUR DRINK I NEVER DRINK BUT AT MY HOURS LIKE THE POPE'S MULE
4198-12259-0008 IF I DRINK NOT I AM A GROUND DRY GRAVELLED AND SPENT I AM STARK DEAD WITHOUT DRINK AND MY SOUL READY TO FLY INTO SOME MARSH AMONGST FROGS THE SOUL NEVER DWELLS IN A DRY PLACE DROUTH KILLS IT
4198-12259-0001 SO MY FRIEND SO WHIP ME OFF THIS GLASS NEATLY BRING ME HITHER SOME CLARET A FULL WEEPING GLASS TILL IT RUN OVER
4198-12259-0029 SPARROWS WILL NOT EAT UNLESS YOU BOB THEM ON THE TAIL NOR CAN I DRINK IF I BE NOT FAIRLY SPOKE TO
4198-61336-0030 UKINZER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHAPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THE SWORD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0017 TIGLATH PILESER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTH EAST
4198-61336-0009 FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN LAND WHERE HE MET WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MENAHEM THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URARTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHUR BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH PILESER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE URARTIAN ARMY IN QUMMUKH
4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING SHARDURIS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHARDURIS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0007 THE SHIFTY MATI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHARDURIS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0012 ITS FALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVENTS IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE HAVE YE OFFERED UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS O HOUSE OF ISRAEL
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS URARTU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
2414-128291-0005 FOR I TELL THEE THAT I HAVE ALREADY TALKED HALF A MORNING UNTO THEM AND JUST NOW WERE THEY ABOUT TO GIVE ME THEIR ANSWER
2414-128291-0018 THOU DOEST VIOLENCE TO THYSELF THOU PREACHER ON THE MOUNT WHEN THOU USEST SUCH SEVERE WORDS
2414-128291-0021 SAID ZARATHUSTRA THOU SHOULDST ALSO SEE MINE ANIMALS MINE EAGLE AND MY SERPENT THEIR LIKE DO NOT AT PRESENT EXIST ON EARTH
2414-128291-0013 THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HOWEVER IS WITH THE KINE AND WHY IS IT NOT WITH THE RICH
2414-128291-0004 ANSWERED HE THE SAME THAT THOU SEEKEST THOU MISCHIEF MAKER THAT IS TO SAY HAPPINESS UPON EARTH
2414-128291-0017 THUS SPAKE THE PEACEFUL ONE AND PUFFED HIMSELF AND PERSPIRED WITH HIS WORDS SO THAT THE KINE WONDERED ANEW
2414-128291-0007 WHO HATH NOT AT PRESENT HIS HEART HIS MOUTH AND HIS EYES FULL OF DISGUST
2414-128291-0002 WHEN HOWEVER ZARATHUSTRA WAS QUITE NIGH UNTO THEM THEN DID HE HEAR PLAINLY THAT A HUMAN VOICE SPAKE IN THE MIDST OF THE KINE AND APPARENTLY ALL OF THEM HAD TURNED THEIR HEADS TOWARDS THE SPEAKER
2414-159411-0028 WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE
2414-159411-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMAN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMAN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMAN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0032 WHEN THE BRAHMAN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0018 AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMAN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAHMAN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAHMAN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANYAN TREE AND THE BRAHMAN SAID TO IT BANYAN TREE BANYAN TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0024 WHEN THEY GOT THERE THE JACKAL SAID NOW BRAHMAN SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU STOOD
2414-159411-0017 THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID THE JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAN
2414-159411-0029 VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0003 I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0033 WHEN THE GOOD BRAHMAN OPENED YOUR CAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0019 BUT THE ALLIGATOR SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME
2414-159411-0020 THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE
2414-159411-0007 THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAHMAN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LET HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAHMAN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-128292-0015 WHEN THE DEVIL CASTETH HIS SKIN DOTH NOT HIS NAME ALSO FALL AWAY IT IS ALSO SKIN
2414-128292-0022 FOR IT DO I ASK AND SEEK AND HAVE SOUGHT BUT HAVE NOT FOUND IT
2414-128292-0009 FOR WHEN ZARATHUSTRA SCRUTINISED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY A SUDDEN APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT DID THIS FOLLOWER APPEAR
2414-165385-0000 THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUETTE AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLUTTERING COXCOMB BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS SENTENCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMICK WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BURDENS AND CURSES WHY
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAIN THERE IS AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH THE LASH FOR THE BABES THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OR THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNER STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSANDS OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD CHARMED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPS IT WITH ITS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT DEVOUR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0017 LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FORTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
8461-258277-0001 BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST I HAVE ZAYNAB ALSO NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR
8461-258277-0008 SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEETMEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BHANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH HIM CHARGER AND CHEST AND ALL TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
8461-258277-0004 AND HAVING THUS ISLAMISED SHE ASKED HIM DO MEN IN THE FAITH OF AL ISLAM GIVE MARRIAGE PORTIONS TO WOMEN OR DO WOMEN DOWER MEN
8461-258277-0010 SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND ADDED IF I KNOW WHITHER THE RASCAL IS GONE AND WHERE TO FIND THE KNAVE I WOULD PAY HIM OUT
8461-258277-0002 THE KNOCKER REPLIED KAMAR DAUGHTER OF AZARIAH THE JEW SAY ME IS ALI OF CAIRO WITH YOU
8461-258277-0012 ANSWERED HASAN I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET SHOWED HIM THE SWEETMEAT SELLER WITHIN DRUGGED AND SENSELESS
8461-258277-0013 SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THE CITY TILL I MET A SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BUYING HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
8461-258277-0009 PRESENTLY HASAN SHUMAN CAME OUT OF A CLOSET AND SAID TO HIM HAST THOU GOTTEN THE GEAR O ALI
8461-281231-0021 BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE TO THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE ULRICA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FRONT DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0012 THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL RUNG WITH THEIR FURIOUS BLOWS
8461-281231-0025 DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
8461-281231-0019 BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF
8461-281231-0008 MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0017 THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
8461-281231-0018 RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
8461-281231-0022 AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANT
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8461-281231-0026 HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY DE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0010 THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
8461-281231-0023 WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
8461-281231-0001 IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE
8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0033 HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0004 LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH ULRICA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
8461-281231-0000 HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THEIR WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LUCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0011 TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADERS EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
8461-281231-0007 THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID ULRICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
8461-281231-0038 THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
8461-281231-0024 HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF CONINGSBURGH AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ATHELSTANE WAS LAID
8461-281231-0002 AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-278226-0007 BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JOUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0013 BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0009 HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0006 IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KERSTALL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0028 MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0027 ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER
4294-9934-0015 YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-14317-0005 I ASK NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SET AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO ANVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMAN GIORGIO DA CORTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARGELLO
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONE WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONIO LANDI WITH HIM
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE ALESSANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTORS CRAFT
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BANDINELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR IF HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON WHOM I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTON
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVERRIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-35475-0022 THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNCILLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND TO BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS OF THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED OH ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0065 WE FEEL MY HUSBAND AND I THAT WE ARE ONLY THE STEWARDS OF HIS BOUNTY AND THAT BECAUSE HE HAS SAID INASMUCH AS YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE MY BRETHREN YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME IT IS THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE AND DELIGHT TO DO ANYTHING FOR HIS PEOPLE
8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACKLEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURN WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN A STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME ON
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0024 FOR YE ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GOD'S
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING INTO HIS STATE ROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WOULD BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THOUGH PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS ON THE MIND
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMEN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
8280-266249-0030 THEY ARE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THAT MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSION
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0051 THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREENBACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DALYS WERE IN VERY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE HOLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL AROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND LOWER THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YOU
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST SAYS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH WHAT CHURCH
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT OF THE GRAVE
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORESS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BOMB HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
3764-168670-0015 THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0054 THE HEARSE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN KNOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0000 THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168670-0049 THE OVER PRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARD DU MAINE PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALIDES
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PERE LACHAISE IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0044 THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTE BOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESTIENNE'S TURN FATHER MESTIENNE DIED
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LENOIR IS HE IS A JUG OF RED WINE
3764-168671-0002 A MOURNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN TO THE DEAD ROOM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENIAL OFFENCE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VAUGIRARD IT HINTED AT POVERTY PERE LACHAISE IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0027 I TORE THE LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0019 IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAS INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSELS OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONICAL AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGED TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABOURERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0033 NONETHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERIOUS VEIL
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAVE BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I WAKE
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-182399-0015 WILL YO' ALLS PLEASE SPEAK A LIL LOUDER HE HOLLER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JES LIKE THAT

3997-182399-0018 WHEN HE GET HOME HE TRY AN TRY TO BRUSH THAT SOOT OFF BUT IT DONE GET INTO THE SKIN AN IT STAY THERE
1998-29455-0027 THE NEW GAME OF BEGGING AND INVENTING STORIES TO INTEREST THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO BEG WENT ON GAILY DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK AND DICKIE BY CONSTANT PRACTICE GREW SO CLEVER AT TAKING HIS PART IN THE ACTING THAT MISTER BEALE WAS QUITE DAZED WITH ADMIRATION
1998-29455-0026 THE NIGHT IS FULL OF INTERESTING LITTLE SOUNDS THAT WILL NOT AT FIRST LET YOU SLEEP THE RUSTLE OF LITTLE WILD THINGS IN THE HEDGES THE BARKING OF DOGS IN DISTANT FARMS THE CHIRP OF CRICKETS AND THE CROAKING OF FROGS

1998-29455-0020 THEY WENT ON UP THE HILL AS HAPPY AS ANY ONE NEED WISH TO BE
1998-29455-0038 THEY DID NOT STAY THERE BUT WALKED OUT ACROSS THE DOWNS WHERE THE SKYLARKS WERE SINGING AND ON A DIP OF THE DOWNS CAME UPON GREAT STONE WALLS AND TOWERS VERY STRONG AND GRAY
1998-29455-0032 IF E'S STRAIGHT E'LL DO FOR ME AND IF HE AIN'T I'LL DO FOR IM SEE
1998-29455-0000 THE SINGING AND LAUGHING WENT ON LONG AFTER HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND IF LATER IN THE EVENING THERE WERE LOUD VOICED ARGUMENTS OR QUARRELS EVEN DICKIE DID NOT HEAR THEM
1998-29455-0035 IF ANY ONE ARSTS YOU IF YOU EVER SEE IM YOU NEVER SET EYES ON IM IN ALL YOUR BORN NOT TO REMEMBER IM
1998-29455-0017 THE TWO TRAVELLERS WERE LEFT FACING EACH OTHER THE RICHER BY A PENNY AND OH WONDERFUL GOOD FORTUNE A WHOLE HALF CROWN

1998-29454-0006 HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND KNEW THAT HE DID NOT AT ALL KNOW WHERE HE WAS
1998-29454-0039 SO YOU SHALL SAID MISTER BEALE A REG'LER WASH ALL OVER THIS VERY NIGHT I ALWAYS LIKE A WASH MESELF
1998-29454-0037 THAT WAS CHARMING BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TOO TO WASH THE MUD OFF ON THE WET GRASS
1998-29454-0011 WHEN IT WAS OVER THE MAN ASKED DICKIE IF HE COULD WALK A LITTLE WAY AND WHEN DICKIE SAID HE COULD THEY SET OUT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY SIDE BY SIDE
1998-29454-0003 HE GOT IT UP AND PUSHED HIS TREASURES AS FAR IN AS HE COULD ALONG THE ROUGH CRUMBLY SURFACE OF THE LATH AND PLASTER
1998-29454-0025 A BIRD PAUSED IN ITS FLIGHT ON A BRANCH QUITE CLOSE AND CLUNG THERE SWAYING
1998-29454-0002 HIS BOOKS TOLD HIM THAT TREASURE IS BEST HIDDEN UNDER LOOSE BOARDS UNLESS OF COURSE YOUR HOUSE HAS A SECRET PANEL WHICH HIS HAD NOT
1998-29454-0023 THE MAN'S MANNER WAS SO KIND AND HEARTY THE WHOLE ADVENTURE WAS SO WONDERFUL AND NEW IS IT COUNTRY WHERE YOU GOING
1998-29454-0015 SHE WAS WAITIN FOR THE WOOD TO BOIL THE KETTLE WHEN I COME OUT MOTHER
1998-29454-0026 HE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET A NEW ENVELOPE A NEW SHEET OF PAPER AND A NEW PENCIL READY SHARPENED BY MACHINERY
1998-29454-0004 WHEN DICKIE CAME DOWN HIS AUNT SLIGHTLY SLAPPED HIM AND HE TOOK THE HALFPENNY AND LIMPED OFF OBEDIENTLY
1998-29454-0041 IF YOU'RE CLEAN THEY SAY HONEST POVERTY AN IF YOU'RE DIRTY THEY SAY SERVE YOU RIGHT
4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
4852-28330-0019 CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY CHRIS RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0029 A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0027 A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
3005-163389-0005 BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARKAND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
3005-163389-0010 THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEELED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING TOLERABLE CHEAP
3005-163389-0000 THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
3005-163389-0014 SO THEN THE RINGMASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3005-163389-0009 NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
3005-163389-0015 IT WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
3005-163389-0006 SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
3005-163389-0012 THEY ARGUED AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW COME TO A STANDSTILL
3005-163389-0003 SHERBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO OUT GAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED SNEAKY
3005-163389-0017 HE SHED THEM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS
3005-163390-0025 WHEN I WAKED UP JUST AT DAYBREAK HE WAS SITTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWIXT HIS KNEES MOANING AND MOURNING TO HIMSELF
3005-163390-0015 AND LOOK AT CHARLES SECOND AND LOUIS FOURTEEN AND LOUIS FIFTEEN AND JAMES SECOND AND EDWARD SECOND AND RICHARD THIRD AND FORTY MORE BESIDES ALL THEM SAXON HEPTARCHIES THAT USED TO RIP AROUND SO IN OLD TIMES AND RAISE CAIN

3005-163390-0005 BUT A BIG FINE LOOKING MAN JUMPS UP ON A BENCH AND SHOUTS HOLD ON
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAW HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME

3005-163391-0008 HE ASKED THE KING WHERE HE WAS GOING AND THE KING TOLD HIM HE'D COME DOWN THE RIVER AND LANDED AT THE OTHER VILLAGE THIS MORNING AND NOW HE WAS GOING UP A FEW MILE TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND ON A FARM UP THERE THE YOUNG FELLOW SAYS
3005-163391-0011 YOU SEE HE WAS PRETTY OLD AND GEORGE'S G'YIRLS WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE MUCH COMPANY FOR HIM EXCEPT MARY JANE THE RED HEADED ONE AND SO HE WAS KINDER LONESOME AFTER GEORGE AND HIS WIFE DIED AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH TO LIVE

3005-163391-0017 OLD PETER HAD FRIENDS AND THEY AIN'T GOING TO LET THEM COME TO NO HARM
3005-163399-0004 WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOMED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS
3005-163399-0000 PHELPS WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE
3005-163399-0001 I WENT AROUND AND CLUMB OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASH HOPPER AND STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN
3005-163399-0021 I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0029 BEING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3005-163399-0016 I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
3005-163399-0003 SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING AFTER
3005-163399-0014 I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND
3005-163399-0012 I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT AROUSED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSINOE HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYES HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMON'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSINOE
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FOR THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTAS THE LEECH CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLUS
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THIS ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0001 BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANOR
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNARES ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0027 THE RHODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSINOE ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMON'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATEUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTILUS
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTILUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERMON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALAESTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24318-0032 EVEN DAPHNE'S IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM RECEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMON WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMON
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPUS SILENCED HER WITH THE GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRTILUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FESTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMYNTAS THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLUS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0027 SO ARCHIAS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SOTELES IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF THIS PAINFUL WALK HERMON
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
7018-75788-0005 THEN HE CARRIED ME TO THE BEACH WHERE I FILLED MY BAG WITH PEBBLES LARGE AND SMALL AND PRESENTLY WE SAW A COMPANY OF FOLK ISSUE FROM THE TOWN EACH BEARING A BAG LIKE MINE FILLED WITH PEBBLES
7018-75788-0008 WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED SAYING HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0012 AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0017 BUT IT BURNETH IN THEIR BELLIES SO THEY CAST IT UP AGAIN AND IT CONGEALETH ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER WHEREBY ITS COLOR AND QUANTITIES ARE CHANGED AND AT LAST THE WAVES CAST IT ASHORE AND THE TRAVELLERS AND MERCHANTS WHO KNOW IT COLLECT IT AND SELL IT
7018-75788-0007 NOW SLEEPING UNDER THESE TREES WERE MANY APES WHICH WHEN THEY SAW US ROSE AND FLED FROM US AND SWARMED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES WHEREUPON MY COMPANIONS BEGAN TO PELT THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN THEIR BAGS AND THE APES FELL TO PLUCKING OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES AND CASTING THEM AT THE FOLK
7018-75788-0002 HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0004 DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND
7018-75788-0001 BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
7018-75788-0014 HERE I FOUND A GREAT SHIP READY FOR SEA AND FULL OF MERCHANTS AND NOTABLES WHO HAD WITH THEM GOODS OF PRICE SO I EMBARKED MY BALES THEREIN
7018-75788-0000 THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
7018-75788-0006 TO THESE HE COMMITTED ME COMMENDING ME TO THEIR CARE AND SAYING THIS MAN IS A STRANGER SO TAKE HIM WITH YOU AND TEACH HIM HOW TO GATHER THAT HE MAY GET HIS DAILY BREAD AND YOU WILL EARN YOUR REWARD AND RECOMPENSE IN HEAVEN
7018-75788-0013 NEXT MORNING AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT HE PRAYED THE DAWN PRAYER AND AFTER BLESSING MOHAMMED THE CREAM OF ALL CREATURES BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN AND WISHED HIM A GOOD DAY
7018-75788-0018 EACH THAT DIED WE WASHED AND SHROUDED IN SOME OF THE CLOTHES AND LINEN CAST ASHORE BY THE TIDES AND AFTER A LITTLE THE REST OF MY FELLOWS PERISHED ONE BY ONE TILL I HAD BURIED THE LAST OF THE PARTY AND ABODE ALONE ON THE ISLAND WITH BUT A LITTLE PROVISION LEFT I WHO WAS WONT TO HAVE SO MUCH
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0019 BUT THERE IS MAJESTY AND THERE IS NO MIGHT SAVE IN ALLAH THE GLORIOUS THE GREAT
7018-75788-0011 THERE I ABODE A LITTLE AND THEN WENT ON TO BAGHDAD WHERE I ENTERED MY QUARTER AND FOUND MY HOUSE AND FOREGATHERED WITH MY FAMILY AND SALUTED MY FRIENDS WHO GAVE ME JOY OF MY SAFE RETURN AND I LAID UP ALL MY GOODS AND VALUABLES IN MY STOREHOUSES
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GIVING IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
7018-75789-0019 HIS LETTER HATH SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MIGHTINESS OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST EYE WITNESSED
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS O NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGHING FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND COMORIN ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIPS STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD MAKING ME A BOAT RAFT A LITTLE NARROWER THAN THE CHANNEL OF THE STREAM AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0008 O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE ARE HUSBANDMEN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THEE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE
7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX
7018-75789-0013 SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE OWN LAND
7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT AND MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0016 THEN I TOOK LEAVE OF HIM AND OF ALL MY INTIMATES AND ACQUAINTANCES IN THE ISLAND AND EMBARKED WITH THE MERCHANTS AFORESAID
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ AWHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT WHOSO COMETH HITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS THE SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TIGHTENING HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HIS SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SATAN THE STONED CLOMB TO THE MAST HEAD WHENCE HE LOOKED OUT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZING AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS FACE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM NOT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0017 HE ASKED ME WHENCE THEY CAME AND I SAID TO HIM BY ALLAH O COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL I KNOW NOT THE NAME OF THE CITY NOR THE WAY THITHER
7018-75789-0003 I ROWED MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0026 KNOW O COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE IN ALL POSSIBLE JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME IN THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TILL MY SOUL BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND HEAR NEW THINGS
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS A THRONE IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBITS HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN O MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TO MORROW INSHALLAH
7018-75789-0015 BY ALLAH O MY LORD ANSWERED I THOU HAST INDEED OVERWHELMED ME WITH THY FAVOURS AND WELL DOINGS BUT I WEARY FOR A SIGHT OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NATIVE COUNTRY
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING THAT HE MAY ACQUAINT HIM WITH HIS ADVENTURES
7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FOR SEA TRADE AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGHDAD CITY TO BASSORAH TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND IN HER A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WONT
7018-75789-0014 QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US ON OUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY
7018-75789-0009 I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE O MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LARGESSE AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRY MAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED
7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DOWNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0019 SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY A RELEASED PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD WE DEFEND IT ON THE ESTIMATES
7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTERBAFF FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT WAS OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RADPROP IS IN TO NIGHT
7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT TO THE IMPROVISED STRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STRODE FORTH TO FREEDOM
7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD OUTSIDE CHANTED WITH AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND WILL VOTE THE OTHER WAY
7105-2330-0006 THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A RIDER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS OF THE HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TRELAWNEY REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT
7105-2330-0018 HE SAYS HE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW
7105-2330-0035 THE WARDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES
7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT A MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLUNTLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE
7105-2330-0004 A HEADLONG PARDON ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANISER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTERBAFF IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0020 AFTER THEY HAD SAID GOOD NIGHT TO THEIR VISITOR MISSUS PETER EXPRESSED HER CONVICTION THAT HE HAD TAKEN SOMETHING
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE
7105-2340-0002 BESIDES CYNICISM APART HIS BEING RICH WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT HIS FAILING
7105-2340-0004 WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HEIR TO HIS UNCLE SIR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE ON THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN MAJOR WILFRID PIGEONCOTE WHO HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE AFTER EFFECTS OF A POLO ACCIDENT
7105-2340-0024 IT'S AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0005 A WILFRID PIGEONCOTE HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONOURS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAME WILFRID HAD BEEN A BAPTISMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO WAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY PERSON TO A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK
7105-2340-0008 THE SEARCH USUALLY PRODUCED A LARGE AND VARIED YIELD THIS IS FUNNY SAID PETER PIGEONCOTE TO HIS WIFE SOME HALF HOUR AFTER THEIR CONVERSATION HERE'S A TELEGRAM FROM WILFRID SAYING HE'S PASSING THROUGH HERE IN HIS MOTOR AND WOULD LIKE TO STOP AND PAY US HIS RESPECTS
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURALLY DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A TIRESOME MALADY
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ONLY IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER AWKWARD ABOUT GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTINE PIGEONCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPASS OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOLDAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OF KLEPTOMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
3528-168669-0129 I WILL PUT EARTH IN THE COFFIN REVEREND MOTHER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE EFFECT OF A CORPSE
3528-168669-0113 IF YOU WERE EVER TO HAVE ANY OTHER JOBS OF THIS SORT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG MAN FOR YOU A PERFECT TURK
3528-168669-0012 AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
3528-168669-0097 GAUTHIER BISHOP OF CHALONS HELD HIS OWN IN THIS MATTER AGAINST OTHO DUKE OF BURGUNDY
3528-168669-0046 IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER CELL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0068 THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0107 THE PEAL WHICH ORDERS THE DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD TO BE SUMMONED HAS ALREADY BEEN RUNG
3528-168669-0050 I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0096 ONE NO LONGER KNOWS WHAT IS DUE TO THE LIVING OR TO THE DEAD A HOLY DEATH IS PROHIBITED
3528-168669-0090 BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGITTAIRE BISHOP OF GAP WAS THE BROTHER OF SALONE BISHOP OF EMBRUN AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM FOLLOWED MOMMOL
3528-168669-0032 A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0082 HIS ORDER HAS PRODUCED FORTY POPES TWO HUNDRED CARDINALS FIFTY PATRIARCHS SIXTEEN HUNDRED ARCHBISHOPS FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BISHOPS FOUR EMPERORS TWELVE EMPRESSES FORTY SIX KINGS FORTY ONE QUEENS THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CANONIZED SAINTS AND HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS

3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH
3528-168669-0079 THE PRIORESS WHO WAS USUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVERFULL ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE LOQUACITY OF A DAM WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY
3528-168669-0011 MERIT CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCK YARD
3528-168669-0057 FATHER FAUVENT MOTHER CRUCIFIXION WILL BE INTERRED IN THE COFFIN IN WHICH SHE HAS SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT IS JUST
3528-168669-0054 SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARRICIDES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE
3528-168669-0117 I WILL DO ANYTHING TO PROVE MY ZEAL TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY THESE ARE MY ORDERS I AM TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN
3528-168669-0031 THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0078 MARTIN THE ELEVENTH GENERAL OF THE CARTHUSIANS GAVE TO HIS ORDER THIS DEVICE STAT CRUX DUM VOLVITUR ORBIS
3528-168669-0076 CHONODEMAIRE ONE OF THE SEVEN GERMAN KINGS WHO ENTERED AMONG THE GAULS UNDER THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTIUS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF NUNS TO BE BURIED IN RELIGION THAT IS TO SAY BENEATH THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0115 I CANNOT WORK VERY FAST I AM INFIRM THAT IS WHY I REQUIRE AN ASSISTANT I LIMP
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCER IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIEN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0017 BY DECLARING THE ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO BLOCK THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISTS AND LAND OWNERS WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED SMOLNY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT'S ALL LET ANY ONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOZE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0009 IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS BREAST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOUR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0031 BUT AT THE END OF FIVE MINUTES HE STOPPED AND THRUST BACK THE DIRK INTO ITS SHEATH
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT
7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0011 NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAL THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0045 RAM SHOWED HIS WHITE TEETH AS HE BURST OUT WITH A LONG LOW FIT OF LAUGHTER
7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0039 I TOLD YOU A FISHER BOY CRIED ARCHY IMPATIENTLY BUT TRYING NOT TO OFFEND HIS VISITOR WHO POSSESSED THE POWER OF CONFERRING FREEDOM BY SPEAKING SHARPLY
7902-96592-0048 BIT OF A MIDDY FED ON SALT TACK AND WEEVILLY BISCUIT TALK OF GIVING ME ROPE'S END
7902-96592-0003 STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY NANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96592-0050 TO HIS ASTONISHMENT THE BOY DID NOT FLINCH BUT THRUST HIS OWN ARMS THROUGH PLACING THEM ABOUT THE MIDDY'S WAIST CLENCHING HIS HANDS BEHIND AND UTTERING A SHARP WHISTLE
7902-96592-0044 I SAY YOU DO LOOK A RUM UN JUST LIKE A BIG MONKEY IN A SHOW
7902-96595-0019 A LAD LOOKING LIKE A COMMON SAILOR AND WEARING A RED CAP NO SAID SIR RISDON
7902-96595-0016 GURR TURNED AWAY IMPATIENTLY AGAIN AND SIGNING TO HIS MEN TO FOLLOW THEY ALL BEGAN TO TRAMP UP THE STEEP TRACK LEADING TOWARD THE HOZE WITH THE RABBITS SCUTTLING AWAY AMONG THE FURZE AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE COTTONY TAILS FOR A MOMENT AS THEY DARTED DOWN INTO THEIR HOLES
7902-96595-0008 IF YOU'D LET ME FINISH YOU'D KNOW SAID GURR GRUFFLY ONE OF OUR BOYS IS MISSING SEEN HIM UP HERE
7902-96595-0012 I SAID A LAD BOUT SEVENTEEN IN A RED CAP LIKE YOURS SAID GURR VERY SHORTLY
7902-96595-0000 SAY MESTER GURR SAID DICK AFTER ONE OF THESE SEARCHES HE WOULDN'T RUN AWAY WHAT
7902-96595-0003 GURR GLANCED ROUND TO SEE IF THE MEN WERE LOOKING AND THEN SAID RATHER HUSKILY BUT KINDLY
7902-96595-0013 THE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND STARED AS IF HE DIDN'T HALF UNDERSTAND THE DRIFT OF WHAT WAS SAID
7902-96595-0018 GURR SALUTED AND STATED HIS BUSINESS WHILE THE BARONET WHO HAD TURNED SALLOWER AND MORE CAREWORN THAN HIS LOT DREW A BREATH FULL OF RELIEF ONE OF YOUR SHIP BOYS HE SAID
7902-96595-0011 IF SHE KNEW EVIL HAD COME TO THE POOR LAD HER FACE WOULD TELL TALES LIKE PRINT
7902-96594-0007 YOU DON'T THINK MISTER GURR THAT THEY WOULD DARE TO INJURE HIM IF HE WAS SO UNLUCKY AS TO BE CAUGHT
7902-96594-0005 AWKWARD BIT O COUNTRY SIR SIX MILES ROW BEFORE YOU CAN FIND A PLACE TO LAND
7902-96594-0026 KEEP A SHARP LOOK OUT ON THE CLIFF TO SEE IF MISTER RAYSTOKE IS MAKING SIGNALS FOR A BOAT
7902-96594-0027 HE SWUNG ROUND WALKED AFT AND BEGAN SWEEPING THE SHORE AGAIN WITH HIS GLASS WHILE THE MASTER AND DICK EXCHANGED GLANCES WHICH MEANT A GREAT DEAL
7902-96594-0029 PIPE AWAY THE MEN TO THAT BOAT THERE HE SAID AND AS THE CREW SPRANG IN
7902-96594-0030 NOW MISTER GURR HE SAID I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY ONE THING TO YOU IN THE WAY OF INSTRUCTIONS YES SIR
7902-96594-0032 STEADY MY LADS STEADY CRIED THE MASTER KEEP STROKE AND THEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS AS TO HIS FIRST PROCEEDINGS ON GETTING ASHORE
367-293981-0002 I SAY REPLIED SANCHO THAT I SWEAR TO HOLD MY TONGUE ABOUT IT TILL THE END OF YOUR WORSHIP'S DAYS AND GOD GRANT I MAY BE ABLE TO LET IT OUT TOMORROW
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0015 SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0010 SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SENOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOUR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WANTED TO CURE ONE OF THE BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS IN THIS INN
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND HE HELD UP THE FLASK OF LIQUOR AND WITH DRINKING TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
367-293981-0008 MINE COULD SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MOOR
367-293981-0018 THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE PIGSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0006 IT CANNOT BE THE MOOR ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE FOR THOSE UNDER ENCHANTMENT DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN BY ANYONE
367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MATERIALS OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
367-293981-0003 THOUGH YOUR WORSHIP WAS NOT SO BADLY OFF HAVING IN YOUR ARMS THAT INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY YOU SPOKE OF BUT I WHAT DID I HAVE EXCEPT THE HEAVIEST WHACKS I THINK I HAD IN ALL MY LIFE
367-293981-0007 IF THEY DON'T LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN THEY LET THEMSELVES BE FELT SAID SANCHO IF NOT LET MY SHOULDERS SPEAK TO THE POINT
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLD WIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DELMONICO
367-130732-0031 PICK THE SHELLS OFF TWENTY FIVE OF THE CRAWFISH TAILS TRIM THEM NEATLY AND SET THEM ASIDE UNTIL WANTED
367-130732-0013 GOBEY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
367-130732-0033 THIS BUTTER IS MADE AS FOLLOWS PLACE THE SHELLS ON A BAKING SHEET IN THE OVEN TO DRY LET THE SHELLS COOL AND THEN POUND THEM IN A MORTAR WITH A LITTLE LOBSTER CORAL AND FOUR OUNCES OF FRESH BUTTER THOROUGHLY BRUISING THE WHOLE TOGETHER SO AS TO MAKE A FINE PASTE
367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE HOF BRAU HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBEY'S OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PRESTIGE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL OF THE FAT FROM THE SHELL
367-130732-0028 PUT THESE INGREDIENTS INTO A STEWPAN AND FRY THEM TEN MINUTES THEN THROW IN THE CRAWFISH AND POUR ON THEM HALF A BOTTLE OF FRENCH WHITE WINE
367-130732-0032 RESERVE SOME OF THE SPAWN ALSO HALF OF THE BODY SHELLS WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE CRAWFISH BUTTER TO FINISH THE SOUP
367-130732-0024 THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING IF YOU ARE GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE
367-130732-0026 TAKE THIRTY CRAWFISH FROM WHICH REMOVE THE GUT CONTAINING THE GALL IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TAKE FIRM HOLD OF THE CRAWFISH WITH THE LEFT HAND SO AS TO AVOID BEING PINCHED BY ITS CLAWS WITH THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER OF THE RIGHT HAND PINCH THE EXTREME END OF THE CENTRAL FIN OF THE TAIL AND WITH A SUDDEN JERK THE GUT WILL BE WITHDRAWN
367-130732-0030 PICK OUT THE CRAWFISH AND STRAIN THE BROTH THROUGH A NAPKIN BY PRESSURE INTO A BASIN IN ORDER TO EXTRACT ALL THE ESSENCE FROM THE VEGETABLES
367-130732-0019 HEAT THIS IN A STEWPAN AND WHEN SIMMERING ADD THE SHERRY AND CRAB MEAT AND LET ALL COOK TOGETHER WITH A SLOW FIRE FOR EIGHT MINUTES
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0027 MINCE OR CUT INTO SMALL DICE A CARROT AN ONION ONE HEAD OF CELERY AND A FEW PARSLEY ROOTS AND TO THESE ADD A BAY LEAF A SPRIG OF THYME A LITTLE MINIONETTE PEPPER AND TWO OUNCES OF BUTTER
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0029 ALLOW THIS TO BOIL AND THEN ADD A QUART OF STRONG CONSOMME AND LET ALL CONTINUE BOILING FOR HALF AN HOUR
367-130732-0011 ONE HAS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELL FISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICERE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGNS OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0018 CINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0023 THEN BRYNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNAR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNAR SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGIN
3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGIN AND REGIN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNIR'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0008 SO REGIN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRYNHILD AND GUDRUN WERE BATHING BRYNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUIRUN'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0018 THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNIR'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RIDE OVER HINDFELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRYNHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
3538-163624-0003 SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS THE UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS THE SQUIRE OF DAMES AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND A SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGEST
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY SCAPE IT
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN'T UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEKE MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETERS
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON'T IS I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THREE S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITHAL AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THESE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUTS THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5040-0013 IF I DROWN BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BEQUEATH ALL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHARGE NEVER TO BESTOW IT ALL UPON ANOTHER MISTRESS LEST MY GHOST RISE AGAIN AND HAUNT YOU
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT E'ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEAS COD WITH NINE PEAS IN'T UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY AND WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRIT BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE IN'T BUT THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMASH
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEYTON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTERS TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0027 WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING TO BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOUR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHIDE WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0047 WE KNOW NOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASSES AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE YAUSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0000 HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0030 AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
533-1066-0015 ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STEWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0005 MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER AT BURYING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP
533-1066-0002 I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I HAVE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU UPON A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO THE TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BENSON ENTERED WITH THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENTLY TRIUMPHING IN MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREAVES MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UPON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
533-131562-0013 NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IT'S BEST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131562-0001 THE KEYS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWERS AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY DESK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN THE LOCK AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0016 I TRY TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0025 CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I'M SURE BY ANYTHING THAT I COULD HAVE SAID
533-131564-0017 I SOUGHT OUT AND PUT INTO HIS HANDS TWO OF MILICENT'S LETTERS ONE DATED FROM LONDON AND WRITTEN DURING ONE OF HIS WILDEST SEASONS OF RECKLESS DISSIPATION THE OTHER IN THE COUNTRY DURING A LUCID INTERVAL
533-131564-0005 WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM
533-131564-0008 BUT TELL ME SHOULD YOU WISH YOUR SONS TO BE LIKE MISTER HUNTINGDON OR EVEN LIKE YOURSELF
533-131564-0019 I'VE BEEN A CURSED RASCAL GOD KNOWS SAID HE AS HE GAVE IT A HEARTY SQUEEZE BUT YOU SEE IF I DON'T MAKE AMENDS FOR IT D N ME IF I DON'T
533-131564-0018 THE FORMER WAS FULL OF TROUBLE AND ANGUISH NOT ACCUSING HIM BUT DEEPLY REGRETTING HIS CONNECTION WITH HIS PROFLIGATE COMPANIONS ABUSING MISTER GRIMSBY AND OTHERS INSINUATING BITTER THINGS AGAINST MISTER HUNTINGDON AND MOST INGENIOUSLY THROWING THE BLAME OF HER HUSBAND'S MISCONDUCT ON TO OTHER MEN'S SHOULDERS
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT THE GROVE A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISTER HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED A DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131564-0020 IF YOU INTEND TO REFORM INVOKE GOD'S BLESSING HIS MERCY AND HIS AID NOT HIS CURSE
533-131556-0006 I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0019 IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR DEBTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE
533-131556-0002 THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER TEETH AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0023 I WOULD NOT FOR MUCH THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW THE INFAMY AND DISGRACE OF HER RELATION
533-131556-0018 I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COAL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0025 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS
260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP
260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0006 WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE ICHTHYOSAURUS AND THE PLESIOSAURUS DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOOL EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123288-0024 THE FIREBALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPOURS CONDENSE INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MISTS ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MIST WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GREY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE THROUGH THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH HAS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0011 BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF THE TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SALINE WATERS
260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMBENT SAINT ELMO'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD
260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0015 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS
3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE
3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE'S STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0022 IN THE EVENINGS I CONFESS I DO THINK BUT I NEVER TROUBLE ANY ONE ELSE WITH MY THOUGHTS
3575-170457-0005 SHE A TORY AND CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DISSENT AND RADICALISM
3575-170457-0030 OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES
3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0015 BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
3575-170457-0038 AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0024 I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TEACHING OR SEWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING BUT I TRY TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PRIVATION
3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
3575-170457-0014 TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY
3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONOURED
3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED UP MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR IN IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0047 TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0017 THOUGH I MAY BE BUT AN UNGRACIOUS ADVISER YOU WILL ALLOW ME THEREFORE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS HERE AND HEREAFTER YOUR TRUE FRIEND ROBERT SOUTHEY
3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SOUTHEY
3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST'S SHOP IN HAWORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRESS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLDS ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBY'S FRACTURED LEG
3575-170457-0035 I WISH IT WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANY ONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0023 I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ECCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS
3575-170457-0029 YOUR LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID NOT TELL YOU SO
3575-170457-0020 I KNOW THE FIRST LETTER I WROTE TO YOU WAS ALL SENSELESS TRASH FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT I AM NOT ALTOGETHER THE IDLE DREAMING BEING IT WOULD SEEM TO DENOTE
3575-170457-0045 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOTBED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR DIRECTION
3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0025 AGAIN I THANK YOU THIS INCIDENT I SUPPOSE WILL BE RENEWED NO MORE IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I SHALL REMEMBER IT THIRTY YEARS HENCE AS A BRIGHT DREAM
3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0026 P S PRAY SIR EXCUSE ME FOR WRITING TO YOU A SECOND TIME I COULD NOT HELP WRITING PARTLY TO TELL YOU HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND PARTLY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOUR ADVICE SHALL NOT BE WASTED HOWEVER SORROWFULLY AND RELUCTANTLY IT MAY BE AT FIRST FOLLOWED C B
3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT IT MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST

908-31957-0012 IF HE TO KEEP ONE OATH MUST LOSE ONE JOY BY HIS LIFE'S STAR FORETOLD
908-31957-0014 A RING OF AMETHYST I COULD NOT WEAR HERE PLAINER TO MY SIGHT THAN THAT FIRST KISS

908-31957-0008 NAY I RATHER THRILLED DISTRUSTING EVERY LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO GILD THE ONWARD PATH AND FEARED TO OVERLEAN A FINGER EVEN
908-31957-0004 SHALL I NEVER MISS HOME TALK AND BLESSING AND THE COMMON KISS THAT COMES TO EACH IN TURN NOR COUNT IT STRANGE WHEN I LOOK UP TO DROP ON A NEW RANGE OF WALLS AND FLOORS ANOTHER HOME THAN THIS
908-31957-0009 AND THOUGH I HAVE GROWN SERENE AND STRONG SINCE THEN I THINK THAT GOD HAS WILLED A STILL RENEWABLE FEAR
908-31957-0021 OH TO SHOOT MY SOUL'S FULL MEANING INTO FUTURE YEARS THAT THEY SHOULD LEND IT UTTERANCE AND SALUTE LOVE THAT ENDURES FROM LIFE THAT DISAPPEARS

7127-75947-0027 TO SAY NOTHING SAID MONTALAIS SO THAT WHEN MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE THINKS ATHENAIS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATER BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75947-0039 IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAME'S AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTED CAVALIERS
7127-75947-0022 I AM A WOMAN AND THERE ARE FEW LIKE ME WHOEVER LOVES ME FLATTERS ME WHOEVER FLATTERS ME PLEASES ME AND WHOEVER PLEASES WELL SAID MONTALAIS YOU DO NOT FINISH
7127-75947-0015 THERE CANNOT BE A DOUBT HE RECEIVED YOU KINDLY FOR IN FACT YOU RETURNED WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION
7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF
7127-75947-0040 IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
7127-75947-0003 YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN
7127-75947-0014 FORGIVE ME I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING A THOUSAND TIMES FORGIVE ME MADAME WAS RIGHT QUITE RIGHT THIS BRUTAL EXILE HAS COMPLETELY TURNED MY BRAIN
7127-75947-0028 QUICK QUICK THEN AMONG THE HIGH REED GRASS SAID MONTALAIS STOOP ATHENAIS YOU ARE SO TALL
7127-75947-0038 LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERT OF THE PARK
7127-75947-0026 WELL SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL BUT I TAKE CARE
7127-75947-0037 OH I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTALAIS AND MY OPINION IN THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE KING'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE
7127-75947-0024 LOOK YONDER DO YOU NOT SEE THE MOON SLOWLY RISING SILVERING THE TOPMOST BRANCHES OF THE CHESTNUTS AND THE OAKS
7127-75947-0033 HOW IS IT LA VALLIERE SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE THAT THE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE SPOKE OF YOU AS LOUISE
7127-75947-0000 EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BEDIMMED
7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLORED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DIAS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATER OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0016 THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRILLE WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE
7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILETTE BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATER SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0002 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMEDY OF MARIVAUX AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SILVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBE CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
3729-6852-0006 SILVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HER SELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENT OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE
3729-6852-0005 SILVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVAUX FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO POSTERITY
3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW IN THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT
3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SILVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SILVIA DIES
3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE CIVET CAT
3729-6852-0037 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO ENQUIRE MY WISHES
3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT OF THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONOURABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAUVEUR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI CHRISTAIN INTOLERANCY OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS THE COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MANKIND
3729-6852-0011 I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
3729-6852-0003 MADAM CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCEVRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCEURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIRE AT THE RATE OF ONE SOU MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE
3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVE TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
672-122797-0002 HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRESH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE COTTAGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PRATTLED WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOODS LOOKING FOR WILD STRAWBERRIES
672-122797-0072 AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE
672-122797-0067 THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
672-122797-0023 HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANYMORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURT YARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
672-122797-0004 IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE
672-122797-0006 TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLDER AND BE TALL THOUGHT THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD
672-122797-0026 THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
672-122797-0042 BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
672-122797-0064 AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
672-122797-0012 I WOULD FAIN KNOW IF I AM DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE REJOICING
672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND IT SIGHED SO DEEPLY
672-122797-0070 THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
672-122797-0071 IN THE COURT YARD SOME OF THE MERRY CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
672-122797-0066 WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
672-122797-0055 AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID
672-122797-0045 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
672-122797-0008 THIS HAPPENED EVERY YEAR AND THE YOUNG FIR TREE THAT HAD NOW GROWN TO A VERY COMELY SIZE TREMBLED AT THE SIGHT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT GREAT TREES FELL TO THE EARTH WITH NOISE AND CRACKING THE BRANCHES WERE LOPPED OFF AND THE TREES LOOKED LONG AND BARE THEY WERE HARDLY TO BE RECOGNISED AND THEN THEY WERE LAID IN CARTS AND THE HORSES DRAGGED THEM OUT OF THE WOOD
672-122797-0022 THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG IT WAS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP
672-122797-0001 THE PLACE HE HAD WAS A VERY GOOD ONE THE SUN SHONE ON HIM AS TO FRESH AIR THERE WAS ENOUGH OF THAT AND ROUND HIM GREW MANY LARGE SIZED COMRADES PINES AS WELL AS FIRS
672-122797-0016 YES THEN SOMETHING BETTER SOMETHING STILL GRANDER WILL SURELY FOLLOW OR WHEREFORE SHOULD THEY THUS ORNAMENT ME
2300-131720-0017 EDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENT CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICTS OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0036 THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0027 EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAN I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS
2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0021 THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT
2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0012 EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER
2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0007 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEEP THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON ELECTROLYTIC METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SCEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS EDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT
2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON METER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
2300-131720-0003 THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF EDISONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND REWEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
1284-1181-0016 I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0013 OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0017 THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX YOU'RE GETTING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0001 MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC NUNKIE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0010 UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0015 WE ARE TRAVELING REPLIED OJO AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOMBI THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLORS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AND A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-134647-0000 THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONATISTS
1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED INVIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0007 PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONATISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN NUMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
1089-134691-0021 THEIR DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSEPLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WET LUSTRE
1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEYED AND WOODBEGIRT AND CITADELLED AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES
1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
1089-134691-0011 THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION
1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS
1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZEWRAPPED CITY
1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEY
1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOUR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLEY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BEATITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BEATITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
1089-134686-0013 IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER KNIGHT
1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMAN IN GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOUR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SODALITY MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHELS
1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
1089-134686-0024 IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HERON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
1089-134686-0028 THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOUR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOUR FATTENED SAUCE
1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
8455-210777-0069 IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAIN BATTLEAX HERE AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMEN A VERY GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0040 THEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT HE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT QUARTER OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
8455-210777-0039 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0044 I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH
8455-210777-0019 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0003 AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
8455-210777-0001 HAD EVA CRASWELLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNIT AND THE BAR KEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0064 AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT
8455-210777-0008 THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
8455-210777-0045 THEN THE REPUBLIC OF BRITANNULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS
8455-210777-0060 THE JOHN BRIGHT IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITANNULA SHOULD PREVAIL
8455-210777-0034 NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TREBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
8455-210777-0016 THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0027 WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FARTHEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYS
8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
8455-210777-0058 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THAT PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK
8455-210777-0046 YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD
8455-210777-0041 THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
8455-210777-0015 I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CRASWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
8455-210777-0013 JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
8455-210777-0053 WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHOULD SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER
8455-210777-0051 WHAT WORLD WIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DISLIKE CENTRED ITSELF ON SIR FERDINANDO
8455-210777-0061 YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTH WEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISTER NEVERBEND BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
8455-210777-0011 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
8455-210777-0055 SIR I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITANNULA
8455-210777-0000 I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0070 AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TOO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE
8455-210777-0059 BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNMENT
8455-210777-0052 YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE THAT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION
8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVERBEND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD BECOME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0038 THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
8455-210777-0057 BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITANNULISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWED THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATIVE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAVE SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES
8455-210777-0031 YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH
8455-210777-0002 ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
8455-210777-0033 BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD ITS SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY
7729-102255-0015 ONE OF HIS MILITIA GENERALS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWS AT LAWRENCE AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARPS RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FORT LEAVENWORTH
7729-102255-0030 HE SUMMONED HALF A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
7729-102255-0026 IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES IN LAWRENCE AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EX GOVERNOR BEEDER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENSES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND UNITED STATES LAWS
7729-102255-0006 COMING BY WAY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDER RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOLDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE
7729-102255-0036 HE PLANTED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES
7729-102255-0018 LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HEMMED AND BOUND IN THE MESHES OF THE VARIOUS DEVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE BOGUS LAWS
7729-102255-0010 OF THE LYNCHINGS THE MOBS AND THE MURDERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AND ATROCIOUS DETAILS
7729-102255-0028 PRIVATE PERSONS WHO HAD LEASED THE FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PREVENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
7729-102255-0020 THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSE WAS SUMMONED NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND REEDER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
7729-102255-0024 THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE RAVINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUE DEFENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRESIDES
7729-102255-0046 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINTH A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LECOMPTON IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
7729-102255-0037 HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOTEL
7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY WERE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE
7729-102255-0045 CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST
7729-102255-0009 ALL DISSENT ALL NON COMPLIANCE ALL HESITATION ALL MERE SILENCE EVEN WERE IN THEIR STRONGHOLD TOWNS LIKE LEAVENWORTH BRANDED AS ABOLITIONISM DECLARED TO BE HOSTILITY TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND PUNISHED WITH PROSCRIPTION PERSONAL VIOLENCE EXPULSION AND FREQUENTLY DEATH
7729-102255-0008 ALL THE TERRITORIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHANNON PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONISTS SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT CHIEF JUSTICE LECOMPTE DIGNIFIED THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS
7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE
7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES
7729-102255-0038 ATCHISON WHO HAD BEEN HARANGUING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM UPON IT
7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONISTS AND OUTLAWS
7729-102255-0031 HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SEARCH AND TO GIVE COLOR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TWO ARRESTS
7729-102255-0019 TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LECOMPTE ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EX GOVERNOR ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
7729-102255-0002 THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSETTS FINDS ITS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION
7729-102255-0029 TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
7729-102255-0016 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISSOURI MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS
7729-102255-0033 AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FEARS
7729-102255-0007 HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PRO SLAVERY AUDITORS
7729-102255-0043 IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND TO WESTPORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO KANSAS CITY AND LEAVENWORTH
7729-102255-0032 THE FREE STATE HOTEL A STONE BUILDING IN DIMENSIONS FIFTY BY SEVENTY FEET THREE STORIES HIGH AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED ONLY FOR LODGING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AND PROVIDED A FREE DINNER IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION
7729-102255-0039 THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED THROUGH THE STONE WALLS
7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCOUTING PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GUERRILLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATORY
7729-102255-0017 SHERIFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION BUT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
7729-102255-0044 HERE HE WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICKAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEAVENWORTH UNDER A REIGN OF TERROR
7729-102255-0042 RELOCATED FOOTNOTE GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING STOPPED AT LEXINGTON MISSOURI
6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER IN NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT
6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS'S FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVASS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED
6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU
6829-68771-0010 THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS
6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH
6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOOD WILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED
6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ELECT HOPKINS
6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH WHITE APRON AND CAP
6829-68771-0027 THEY THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME
6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED
6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY
6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE
6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR
6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK KNEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SECURED FROM THE OPPOSITION
6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH
6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FETE
6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN'T SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS
6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY
6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMAN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE
6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THE ONLY ONE WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN INVITED GUESTS
6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES
6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORBES'S AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRL HAS BEEN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER
6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A BENCH HERE
6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES I'M THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AN I DUNNO WHICH IS WORST DYIN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
6829-68769-0048 GIVE ME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS
6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT
6829-68769-0030 I WAS BOOKKEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE
6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID
6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES
6829-68769-0018 MISS DE GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT
6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE
6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM
6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL UNFEELING THAN TO KNOW THE TRUTH
6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED THEM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY
6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS'S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK
6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR
6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY JAIL
6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD HER ACCIDENT
6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM
6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGERS WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN
6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME
6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY MERE BLUFF
6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER
61-70970-0035 WARRENTON SPOKE THUS WITH SIGNIFICANCE TO SHOW ROBIN THAT HE WAS NOT TO THINK GEOFFREY'S CLAIMS TO THE ESTATE WOULD BE PASSED BY
61-70970-0031 CRIED HE WAVING THE LANTHORN BEFORE HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WERE NO GHOSTS IN FRONT OF HIM
61-70970-0015 WILL CRIED HE SOFTLY AND STUTELEY WHO HAD CHOSEN HIS COUCH ACROSS THE DOOR OF HIS YOUNG MASTER'S CHAMBER SPRANG UP AT ONCE IN ANSWER
61-70970-0037 HIS TONES RANG PLEASANTLY ON WARRENTON'S EARS AND FORTHWITH A GOOD FELLOWSHIP WAS HERALDED BETWEEN THEM
61-70970-0013 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO ALTER HIS SLEEPING ROOM TO ONE NEARER TO GAMEWELL'S CHAMBER
61-70970-0016 WE WILL GO OUT TOGETHER TO THE BOWER THERE IS A WAY DOWN TO THE COURT FROM MY WINDOW
61-70970-0000 YOUNG FITZOOTH HAD BEEN COMMANDED TO HIS MOTHER'S CHAMBER SO SOON AS HE HAD COME OUT FROM HIS CONVERSE WITH THE SQUIRE
61-70970-0007 HE WAS IN DEEP CONVERSE WITH THE CLERK AND ENTERED THE HALL HOLDING HIM BY THE ARM
61-70970-0039 HE IMPLORES US TO BE DISCREET AS THE GRAVE IN THIS MATTER FOR IN SOOTH HIS LIFE IS IN THE HOLLOW OF OUR HANDS
61-70970-0025 THEY WERE UPON THE VERGE OF AN OPEN TRAP IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE HUT AND STUTELEY HAD TRIPPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE REVERSED FLAP MOUTH OF THIS PIT
61-70970-0024 THEY MOVED THEREAFTER CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE HUT GROPING BEFORE AND ABOUT THEM TO FIND SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WARRENTON HAD FULFILLED HIS MISSION
61-70970-0011 AS ANY IN ENGLAND I WOULD SAY SAID GAMEWELL PROUDLY THAT IS IN HIS DAY
61-70970-0028 STUTELEY WAS BY HIS SIDE IN A FLASH AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN FEELING ABOUT THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE SHAPE AND CHARACTER OF THIS VAULT
61-70970-0038 THE OLD SERVANT TOLD HIM QUIETLY AS THEY CREPT BACK TO GAMEWELL THAT THIS PASSAGE WAY LED FROM THE HUT IN THE PLEASANCE TO SHERWOOD AND THAT GEOFFREY FOR THE TIME WAS HIDING WITH THE OUTLAWS IN THE FOREST
61-70970-0001 THERE BEFELL AN ANXIOUS INTERVIEW MISTRESS FITZOOTH ARGUING FOR AND AGAINST THE SQUIRE'S PROJECT IN A BREATH
61-70970-0026 FITZOOTH'S HAND RESTED AT LAST UPON THE TOP RUNG OF A LADDER AND SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME TO HIM
61-70970-0021 THEY THEN RENEWED THEIR JOURNEY AND UNDER THE BETTER LIGHT MADE A SAFE CROSSING OF THE STABLE ROOFS
61-70970-0036 ROBIN FITZOOTH SAW THAT HIS DOUBTS OF WARRENTON HAD BEEN UNFAIR AND HE BECAME ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HARBORING THEM
61-70968-0011 HE GAVE WAY TO THE OTHERS VERY READILY AND RETREATED UNPERCEIVED BY THE SQUIRE AND MISTRESS FITZOOTH TO THE REAR OF THE TENT
61-70968-0050 HE MADE AN EFFORT TO HIDE HIS CONDITION FROM THEM ALL AND ROBIN FELT HIS FINGERS TIGHTEN UPON HIS ARM
61-70968-0030 NOW BE SILENT ON YOUR LIVES HE BEGAN BUT THE CAPTURED APPRENTICE SET UP AN INSTANT SHOUT
61-70968-0043 FRIENDS SAID MONTFICHET FAINTLY TO THE WRESTLERS BEAR US ESCORT SO FAR AS THE SHERIFF'S HOUSE
61-70968-0017 I COULD NOT SEE MY BOY INJURED EXCELLENCE FOR BUT DOING HIS DUTY AS ONE OF CUMBERLAND'S SONS
61-70968-0003 HE WAS LIKE UNTO MY FATHER IN A WAY AND YET WAS NOT MY FATHER
61-70968-0047 MASTER MONCEUX THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM WAS MIGHTILY PUT ABOUT WHEN TOLD OF THE RIOTING
61-70968-0014 WHAT IS THE TUMULT AND RIOTING CRIED OUT THE SQUIRE AUTHORITATIVELY AND HE BLEW TWICE ON A SILVER WHISTLE WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT
61-70968-0000 HE BEGAN A CONFUSED COMPLAINT AGAINST THE WIZARD WHO HAD VANISHED BEHIND THE CURTAIN ON THE LEFT
61-70968-0032 HE FELT FOR AND FOUND THE WIZARD'S BLACK CLOTH THE SQUIRE WAS QUITE OUT OF BREATH
61-70968-0028 THE HEAD AND CHIEF OF THE RIOT THE NOTTINGHAM APPRENTICE WITH CLENCHED FISTS THREATENED MONTFICHET
61-70968-0049 HAVE YOUR WILL CHILD IF THE BOY ALSO WILLS IT MONTFICHET ANSWERED FEELING TOO ILL TO OPPOSE ANYTHING VERY STRONGLY JUST THEN
61-70968-0010 FORTHWITH ALL RAN TO THE OPENING OF THE TENT TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE AMISS BUT MASTER WILL WHO PEEPED OUT FIRST NEEDED NO MORE THAN ONE GLANCE
61-70968-0023 BUT I WRESTLED WITH THIS FELLOW AND DO KNOW THAT HE PLAYED UNFAIRLY IN THE SECOND BOUT
61-70968-0033 THRUSTING OPEN THE PROPER ENTRANCE OF THE TENT ROBIN SUDDENLY RUSHED FORTH WITH HIS BURDEN WITH A GREAT SHOUT
61-70968-0035 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS THE SQUIRE'S FEW MEN REDOUBLED THEIR EFFORTS AND ENCOURAGED BY ROBIN'S AND THE LITTLE STROLLER'S CRIES FOUGHT THEIR WAY TO HIM
61-70968-0027 ROBIN AND THE LITTLE TUMBLER BETWEEN THEM TRIED TO FORCE THE SQUIRE TO STAND BACK AND VERY VALIANTLY DID THESE TWO COMPORT THEMSELVES
61-70968-0026 THE STROLLERS TOOK THEIR PART IN IT WITH HEARTY ZEST NOW THAT THEY HAD SOME CHANCE OF BEATING OFF THEIR FOES
61-70968-0054 MISTRESS FITZOOTH HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY THE SHERIFF'S DAUGHTER AND HER MAIDS AS SOON AS THEY HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE SO THAT ROBIN ALONE HAD THE CARE OF MONTFICHET
8555-292519-0003 IN A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES THE GLORY OF THE WORLD A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED WHO IS HUNG WITH TAPESTRIES RICH AND OLD
8555-292519-0006 THE PLEASANT GRAVEYARD OF MY SOUL WITH SENTIMENTAL CYPRESS TREES AND FLOWERS IS FILLED THAT I MAY STROLL IN MEDITATION AT MY EASE
8555-292519-0009 HO YE SAILS THAT SEEM TO WANDER IN DREAM FILLED MEADOWS SAY IS THE SHORE WHERE I STAND THE ONLY FIELD OF STRUGGLE OR ARE YE HIT AND BATTERED OUT THERE BY WAVES AND WIND GUSTS AS YE TACK OVER A CLASHING SEA OF WATERY ECHOES
8555-292519-0000 BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWN'S MOST BRILLIANT DYE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLOR THROUGH THE SKY THAT SWIRL AND SWEEP AND MEET TO BREAK AND FOAM LIKE RAINBOW VEILS UPON A BUBBLE'S DOME
8555-292519-0007 IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN THE SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAVE FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIGH
8555-292519-0001 GUIDED BY YOU HOW WE MIGHT STROLL TOWARDS DEATH OUR ONLY MUSIC ONE ANOTHER'S BREATH THROUGH GARDENS INTIMATE WITH HOLLYHOCKS WHERE SILENT POPPIES BURN BETWEEN THE ROCKS BY POOLS WHERE BIRCHES BEND TO CONFIDANTS ABOVE GREEN WATERS SCUMMED WITH LILY PLANTS
8555-284449-0012 I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED THE NEW BOOLOOROO AND I'LL FEED THE HONORABLE GOAT ALL THE SHAVINGS AND LEATHER AND TIN CANS HE CAN EAT BESIDES THE GRASS
8555-284449-0004 SINCE LAST THURSDAY I GHIP GHISIZZLE HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONQUERED BY QUEEN TROT I SUPPOSE I AM CONQUERED TOO AND YOU HAVE NO BOOLOOROO AT ALL
8555-284449-0003 WHEN THE BLUESKINS SAW GHIP GHISIZZLE THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE SOLDIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE
8555-284449-0017 WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THRONE ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND JEERED THEM FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED THE PRINCESSES THE LEAST LITTLE BIT
8555-284449-0016 AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE
8555-284449-0013 SCUSE ME SAID TROT I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BOOLOOROO ANY MORE
8555-284449-0019 THAT EVENING TROT GAVE A GRAND BALL IN THE PALACE TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PINKIES AND THE BLUESKINS WERE INVITED
8555-284449-0007 NOW THEN LET'S ENTER THE CITY AN ENJOY THE GRAND FEAST THAT'S BEING COOKED I'M NEARLY STARVED MYSELF FOR THIS CONQUERIN KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK
8555-284449-0020 THE COMBINED BANDS OF BOTH THE COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPPER WAS SERVED
8555-284449-0011 THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BOOLOOROO OUT OF THE FRAME HE WAS TIED IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE
8555-284449-0002 AT THE HEAD OF THE PINKIES WERE GHIP GHISIZZLE AND BUTTON BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER AND THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORALIE AND CAPTAIN TINTINT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH
8555-284449-0018 SO GHIP GHISIZZLE ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO THEIR NEW HOME
8555-284449-0008 THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING THE KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
8555-284449-0001 THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF PINKIES HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WAS ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARD THEM
8555-284449-0000 SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLASTS OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF CYMBALS TOLD TROT AND CAP'N BILL THAT THE BLUE BANDS HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE PALACE
8555-284447-0014 THE IDEA OF PATCHING CAP'N BILL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER
8555-284447-0023 I COULDN'T SHIVER MUCH BEIN BOUND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I'M LOOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUS ONE GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELIN'S
8555-284447-0018 AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPED FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BOOLOOROO
8555-284447-0007 THEREFORE HER MAJESTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER
8555-284447-0001 HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND OATMEAL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH HIM
8555-284447-0017 WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BOOLOOROO LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE
8555-284447-0008 RICH JEWELS OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PERSONS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGEOUS AS THEY WERE HAUGHTY AND OVERBEARING
8555-284447-0006 IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THRONE CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS FOR THE SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES
8555-284447-0005 THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROWS OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATORS TO SIT UPON
8555-284447-0021 THEN THEY SPED IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GOAT GAVE A FINAL BUTT THAT SENT THE ROW OF ROYAL LADIES ALL DIVING INTO THE CORRIDOR IN ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREUPON THEY SHRIEKED IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED EVERYONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES
8555-284447-0015 THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEY'RE NEARLY THE SAME SIZE IF YOU STAND THE GOAT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STYLE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'RE BOTH OF EM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDID
8555-284447-0010 CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE BOOLOOROO THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNOW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANYONE THIS PRISONER IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU'LL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS
8555-284447-0019 BEFORE ANY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAJESTY SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE KING SOARED FAR INTO THE AIR AND TUMBLED IN A HEAP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MOANING AND GROANING
8555-284447-0002 I WOULDN'T MIND A CUP O COFFEE MYSELF SAID CAP'N BILL I'VE HAD CONSID'BLE EXERCISE THIS MORNIN AND I'M ALL READY FOR BREAKFAS
8555-284447-0013 WHY YOU SAID TO FETCH THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE WE MET AND THAT WAS THIS BILLYGOAT REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOAT'S HORNS
8555-284447-0000 THEN HE RUSHED DOWN STAIRS INTO THE COURTYARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO PATCH EVERYBODY IN HIS DOMINIONS IF THE SAILORMAN WAS NOT RECAPTURED
8555-284447-0004 AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE THE BOOLOOROO GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT
8463-294828-0038 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY
8463-294828-0028 I OPENED A LINE OF CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BABIRUSA AND CONSEIL AT MY HEELS I JUMPED INTO A CARRIAGE
8463-294828-0027 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE
8463-294828-0013 HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME
8463-294828-0007 CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE
8463-294828-0002 EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
8463-294828-0014 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
8463-294828-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO
8463-294828-0017 PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY
8463-294828-0033 I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS
8463-294828-0035 AND SO IF I'D BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM
8463-294828-0036 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS
8463-294828-0003 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS
8463-294828-0010 NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS
8463-294828-0001 THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER I NO MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRYING FOR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE
8463-294828-0031 ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTERDECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME
8463-287645-0007 ANOTHER CASE SAID JOHN WESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS IN A RAGE THE MISTRESS HIT HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELL TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF
8463-287645-0005 A FEW YEARS BACK ONE OF THEIR SLAVES A COACHMAN WAS KEPT ON THE COACH BOX ONE COLD NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE OUT AT A BALL UNTIL HE BECAME ALMOST FROZEN TO DEATH IN FACT HE DID DIE IN THE INFIRMARY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE FROST ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTERWARDS
8463-287645-0011 SHE WAS A LARGE HOMELY WOMAN THEY WERE COMMON WHITE PEOPLE WITH NO REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY
8463-287645-0006 THE DOCTOR WHO ATTENDED THE INJURED CREATURE IN THIS CASE WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT SHE SLIPPED AND FELL DOWN STAIRS AS SHE WAS COMING DOWN
8463-287645-0002 FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO ROBERT HOLLAN NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS ENTHRALMENT WHILE UNDER HOLLAN WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
8463-287645-0003 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HOLLAN
8463-287645-0013 AS TO HIS AGE AND ALSO THE NAME OF HIS MASTER JACOB'S STATEMENT VARIED SOMEWHAT FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT
8463-294825-0001 THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DARK POWER AND OTHERWORLDLY FASCINATION OF TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAS
8463-294825-0006 HIS SPECIFICATIONS FOR AN OPEN SEA SUBMARINE AND A SELF CONTAINED DIVING SUIT WERE DECADES BEFORE THEIR TIME YET MODERN TECHNOLOGY BEARS THEM OUT TRIUMPHANTLY
8463-294825-0009 THIS COMPULSION LEADS NEMO INTO UGLY CONTRADICTIONS HE'S A FIGHTER FOR FREEDOM YET ALL WHO BOARD HIS SHIP ARE IMPRISONED THERE FOR GOOD HE WORKS TO SAVE LIVES BOTH HUMAN AND ANIMAL YET HE HIMSELF CREATES A HOLOCAUST HE DETESTS IMPERIALISM YET HE LAYS PERSONAL CLAIM TO THE SOUTH POLE
8463-294825-0013 FOR MANY THEN THIS BOOK HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF FASCINATION SURELY ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL NOVELS EVER WRITTEN AN INSPIRATION FOR SUCH SCIENTISTS AND DISCOVERERS AS ENGINEER SIMON LAKE OCEANOGRAPHER WILLIAM BEEBE POLAR TRAVELER SIR ERNEST SHACKLETON
8463-294825-0007 EVEN THE SUPPORTING CAST IS SHREWDLY DRAWN PROFESSOR ARONNAX THE CAREER SCIENTIST CAUGHT IN AN ETHICAL CONFLICT CONSEIL THE COMPULSIVE CLASSIFIER WHO SUPPLIES HUMOROUS TAG LINES FOR VERNE'S FAST FACTS THE HARPOONER NED LAND A CREATURE OF CONSTANT APPETITES MAN AS HEROIC ANIMAL

237-134500-0032 I GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
237-134500-0033 I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
237-134500-0013 MARIE PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0037 BUT EMIL IF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
237-134500-0000 FRANK READ ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRIER HE GREW
237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SCYTHE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
237-134500-0036 I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MARIE
237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHABATA AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLE CLOTH
237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME

237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0010 OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME

237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAYLY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER VANES ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORANGE HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MATED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDRA BERGSON
237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK
237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKER BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEEHIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
1580-141084-0008 I CANNOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS
1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCHRIST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
1580-141084-0002 THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0009 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0033 COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL
1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
1580-141084-0048 IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
1580-141084-0011 WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER
1580-141084-0026 IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL
1580-141084-0047 I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SOAMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
1580-141084-0034 WELL WELL DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE
1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0031 HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0036 HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0044 I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0034 AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0042 MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0009 THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS SLANG
4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG
4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF
4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FOR A HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TO MORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBE OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTEBRAL COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED AND FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BLEED AND THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP AND THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO FAST AND THOSE WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICT IT
4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSE SLANG
4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP THE GUTTER THE HAIRDRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALYBACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG
4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY
4507-16021-0001 IT ENGENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LA PEGRE FOR WHICH READ THEFT AND A HELL LA PEGRENNE FOR WHICH READ HUNGER
4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GULF A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG
4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MATERIALISM AND CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0038 BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL
1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TWO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY DEFINE THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE
1188-133604-0015 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0001 THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CHIAROSCURISTS
1188-133604-0009 NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0017 THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
1188-133604-0026 HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST APOLLO AND THE PYTHON
1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0028 WELL THEN LAST HERE IS TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE
1188-133604-0023 THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DUERER
1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE
1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CHIAROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEAF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATERMILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN
1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORIST WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE
1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
1188-133604-0032 IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BURNE JONES IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PURIST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WAR WOLF AND THE GIER EAGLE
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHAISE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION UPON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CAN NOT BE OVERRATED
7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK ANDERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
7021-85628-0008 FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS
7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET ANDERS SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79740-0010 DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE ANDELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0013 PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANY THING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0002 NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESSES UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
121-127105-0029 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
121-127105-0022 WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS
121-127105-0005 I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSE THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT
121-127105-0013 YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
121-127105-0026 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
121-127105-0000 IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT DREW FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
121-127105-0020 WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITERAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEN
121-127105-0028 THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
121-127105-0024 POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
121-127105-0031 SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
121-127105-0011 SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
121-127105-0025 THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
121-127105-0002 CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
121-127105-0023 LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
121-127105-0035 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
121-127105-0027 HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
121-127105-0007 TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH THANK GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
121-121726-0010 HOUSECLEANING A DOMESTIC UPHEAVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS IT NEEDS
121-121726-0000 ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SEASON
121-123859-0001 O TIS THE FIRST TIS FLATTERY IN MY SEEING AND MY GREAT MIND MOST KINGLY DRINKS IT UP MINE EYE WELL KNOWS WHAT WITH HIS GUST IS GREEING AND TO HIS PALATE DOTH PREPARE THE CUP IF IT BE POISON'D TIS THE LESSER SIN THAT MINE EYE LOVES IT AND DOTH FIRST BEGIN
121-123859-0004 SO I RETURN REBUK'D TO MY CONTENT AND GAIN BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
121-123859-0003 LOVE IS A BABE THEN MIGHT I NOT SAY SO TO GIVE FULL GROWTH TO THAT WHICH STILL DOTH GROW
121-123852-0002 NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FARTHEST EARTH REMOV'D FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH SEA AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE BUT AH
5142-36600-0001 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANKED AS SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
5142-36586-0003 BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
5142-36377-0004 SHE SIGNED TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SOLEMNITY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
5142-36377-0024 NAOMI SHOOK HER FOREFINGER REPROACHFULLY AT THEM AS IF THE TWO STURDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN
5142-36377-0006 A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM
5142-36377-0009 PHILIP LEFRANK THIS IS MY OVERLOOKER MISTER JAGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMALLY PRESENTING US
5142-36377-0001 IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD AND MY MELANCHOLY ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVELIEST FRENCH COMPANY
5142-36377-0005 THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I HONESTLY CONFESS BEING VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER OF THEM
5142-36377-0003 AMBROSE MET ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0008 MISTER MEADOWCROFT THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED THE NEWCOMER TO ME WITH A SIDE GLANCE AT HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN
5142-36377-0007 A LITTLE CRACKED THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE WAS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
5142-36377-0022 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEADOWCROFT'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE
5142-36377-0015 OUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE RIGHT IMPRESSIONS
5142-36377-0014 A PRETTY GIRL AND SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO DESCRIBING HER GENERALLY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SET ON HER SHOULDERS BRIGHT GRAY EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONED VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH EARS
5142-36377-0002 THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE AND UNCOMPROMISING BELL RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY
5142-36377-0010 HE IS NOT WELL HE HAS COME OVER THE OCEAN FOR REST AND CHANGE OF SCENE
5142-36377-0013 THEY POINTEDLY DREW BACK FROM JOHN JAGO AS HE APPROACHED THE EMPTY CHAIR NEXT TO ME AND MOVED ROUND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE
5142-36377-0020 A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT AT THE TABLE WITH
5142-36377-0023 YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT TO SAY NO AMBROSE BEGAN NEVER SMOKE WITH JOHN JAGO HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU
5142-36377-0025 SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST AMBROSE STOOD HIS GROUND EVIDENTLY BENT ON MAKING HIS PEACE WITH NAOMI BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM
5142-33396-0046 BY THE BEARD OF ODIN I CRIED YOU HAVE TAKEN OUR JOKE LIKE A MAN
5142-33396-0044 I AM STIFF WITH LONG SITTING HE SAID I ITCH FOR A FIGHT I TURNED TO THE FARMER
5142-33396-0034 THEN I DRANK HALF OF THE HORNFUL AND SENT THE REST ACROSS THE FIRE TO THE FARMER HE TOOK IT AND SMILED SAYING
5142-33396-0023 IT WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARKS ON THE HEARTH
5142-33396-0042 SO NO TALES GOT OUT TO THE NEIGHBORS BESIDES IT WAS A LONELY PLACE AND BY GOOD LUCK NO ONE CAME THAT WAY
5142-33396-0036 SO I WILL GIVE OUT THIS LAW THAT MY MEN SHALL NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE
5142-33396-0019 OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON THE SEA AND LET OTHER MEN RAISE YOUR CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS
5142-33396-0059 YES AND WITH ALL YOUR FINGERS IT TOOK YOU A YEAR TO CATCH ME THE KING FROWNED MORE ANGRILY
5142-33396-0054 THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DECIDE FOR THE SPEAR WILL ALWAYS POINT SOMEWHERE AND ONE THING IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
5142-33396-0032 THE FARMER SAT GLOOMILY ON THE BENCH AND WOULD NOT EAT AND YOU CANNOT WONDER FOR HE SAW US PUTTING POTFULS OF HIS GOOD BEEF AND BASKET LOADS OF BREAD INTO OUR BIG MOUTHS
5142-33396-0065 SOFT HEART HE SAID GENTLY TO HER THEN TO THORKEL WELL LET HIM GO THORKEL
5142-33396-0053 I TOOK FIVE GREAT BRACELETS OF GOLD FROM OUR TREASURE CHEST AND GAVE THEM TO HIM
5142-33396-0006 I MADE HER FOR ONLY TWENTY OARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT FEW MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
5142-33396-0052 HERE IS A RING FOR SIF THE FRIENDLY AND HERE IS A BRACELET A SWORD WOULD NOT BE ASHAMED TO HANG AT YOUR SIDE
5142-33396-0007 AT THE PROW I CARVED THE HEAD WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FORKED TONGUE THRUST OUT
5142-33396-0038 HE SHALL NOT LEAVE YOU DAY OR NIGHT WHETHER YOU ARE WORKING OR PLAYING OR SLEEPING
5142-33396-0031 THEY SET UP A CRANE OVER THE FIRE AND HUNG THE POT UPON IT AND WE SAT AND WATCHED IT BOIL WHILE WE JOKED AT LAST THE SUPPER BEGAN
5142-33396-0068 SO I LIVED AND NOW AM YOUR TOOTH THRALL WELL IT IS THE LUCK OF WAR
5142-33396-0015 AS OUR BOAT FLASHED DOWN THE ROLLERS INTO THE WATER I MADE THIS SONG AND SANG IT
5142-33396-0012 THEN I WILL GET ME A FARM AND WILL WINTER IN THAT LAND NOW WHO WILL FOLLOW ME
5142-33396-0024 I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO SWORD REACHING OUT OF THE DARK FOR ME
3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE QUASI PEACEABLE CULTURE
3570-5696-0006 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0002 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY AND INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALKERS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR ANTEDATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALISED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS
3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0003 WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TABU MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TABU OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE
3570-5694-0001 THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH
3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TABU CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER
3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0001 THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENSE OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS
1995-1826-0023 GOOBERS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF VINES BUT UNDERGROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAMS IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TODAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARK SEEMED CALLED FOR
1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON
1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE
1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WELL OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LITERALLY BORN IN COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM
1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ARE ARRIVING AT A BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS
1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESTS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND DISQUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CREIGHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CREIGHTON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESSWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GUESTS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTERESTS EARLIER IN THE DAY
1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GREY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH
1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINING OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HIGHEST CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM
1995-1836-0010 THE VANDERPOOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPEST SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM
1995-1836-0000 THE HON CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UPTOWN FROM MISTER EASTERLY'S WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE
1995-1836-0001 AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE
1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESSWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION
1995-1837-0023 THE NET AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED AND STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
1995-1837-0024 FOR A WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SUN AND BIRD AND TREE
1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THICK TALL WET AND WILLOWY
1995-1837-0003 THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL ROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP
1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF THE COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED
1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOME ONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
1995-1837-0004 HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT OR CARED AND KNEW NOT
1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
6930-76324-0004 BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION
6930-76324-0008 I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT'S BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL
6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING AN OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0011 THEY WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME CYN
6930-76324-0006 HERS HAPPENED TO BE IN THE SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT
6930-76324-0028 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-76324-0015 SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT
6930-76324-0016 THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
6930-76324-0012 WE'LL COME IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
6930-76324-0005 THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL
6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
6930-76324-0021 SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0020 YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW KAFFAR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0006 WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLOURED
6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH A PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFFAR
6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
6930-75918-0016 YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0020 BRAGELONNE WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANICAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WHO ARE MISTAKEN RAOUL I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAD SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE
6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAOUL COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FORWARDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
6930-75918-0005 THE COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED BEFORE THEM
6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
6930-75918-0015 THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOR OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY'S OUR MASTER'S AND OUR OWN
2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0022 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLEITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS
2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0009 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES
2961-960-0016 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0021 THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS
2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0002 IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WITH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE AND CONNECT ABSTRACTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INTRODUCTION IN WHICH HE IS USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MAN
2961-961-0022 THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MAN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORD SPOKE
2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SOLON'S WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF DROPIDAS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0008 BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAS PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
2961-961-0011 THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNALS SOLON ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUNDED OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD
2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
4446-2273-0001 THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM IN CHELSEA AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HILDA
4446-2273-0025 IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEE
4446-2273-0008 I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDING POOR COUSIN MIKE OVER BAD SEASONS
4446-2273-0003 WHEN BARTLEY ARRIVED AT BEDFORD SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIE THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UPSTAIRS
4446-2273-0000 HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
4446-2273-0016 HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BAINS DE MER
4446-2273-0035 BARTLEY LEANED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES
4446-2273-0021 WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER OUR FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANCS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH
4446-2273-0004 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKERY
4446-2273-0010 THERE WAS WATERCRESS SOUP AND SOLE AND A DELIGHTFUL OMELETTE STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS AND TRUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ARTICHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW RHONE WINE OF WHICH BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND
4446-2273-0022 THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE
4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
4446-2273-0024 BARTLEY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG THE LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THAT
4446-2273-0032 HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE
4446-2275-0026 SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS
4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UNBUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM
4446-2275-0033 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG
4446-2275-0040 THE SIGHT OF YOU BARTLEY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
4446-2275-0043 BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH AND HER WET TIRED EYES
4446-2275-0012 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
4446-2275-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
4446-2275-0005 I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP
4446-2275-0019 THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE
4446-2275-0000 THE STOP AT QUEENSTOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSEY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE
4446-2275-0001 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
4446-2275-0007 SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL
4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD HER THAT THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
4446-2271-0009 MAINHALL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM
4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT
4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS OR MECHANICS
4446-2271-0008 IRENE BURGOYNE ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
4446-2271-0014 WESTMERE AND I WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF
4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SINGING LIKE SOME ONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD
4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
4970-29095-0024 IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND AT THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW BONNET
4970-29095-0021 BUT NEITHER SAINT GIRARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MINT NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON EIGHTH STREET
4970-29095-0037 BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
4970-29095-0035 AND IF I HAD A FORTUNE WOULD THEE WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE
4970-29095-0004 I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN ABNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW
4970-29095-0003 I HOPE THEE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS THEE LOVES MUSIC THEE IS NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED
4970-29095-0028 HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDNESDAY MEETING HUMPH IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
4970-29095-0006 IS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
4970-29095-0026 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
4970-29095-0032 BUT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY
4970-29095-0001 SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANO SANG A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEATING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER
4970-29095-0018 RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MAUSOLEUM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANY BODY
4970-29095-0034 WHY SHOULD I RUST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN INACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL
4970-29095-0027 IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LINE THE CURBSTONE AND STARE AT US AS WE COME OUT
4970-29095-0007 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
4970-29095-0020 THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIAN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
4970-29095-0038 RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
4970-29095-0031 HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THEE KNOWS FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A NEW COUNTRY
4970-29095-0033 WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
4970-29095-0016 RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE INTENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW
4970-29093-0002 HE HAS NO TRADITIONS TO BIND HIM OR GUIDE HIM AND HIS IMPULSE IS TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OCCUPATION HIS FATHER HAS FOLLOWED AND MAKE A NEW WAY FOR HIMSELF
4970-29093-0010 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPEVINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
4970-29093-0003 THE MODEST FELLOW WOULD HAVE LIKED FAME THRUST UPON HIM FOR SOME WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT IT MIGHT BE FOR A BOOK OR FOR THE SKILLFUL MANAGEMENT OF SOME GREAT NEWSPAPER OR FOR SOME DARING EXPEDITION LIKE THAT OF LIEUTENANT STRAIN OR DOCTOR KANE
4970-29093-0005 SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICUOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BUL BUL SINGS ON THE OFF NIGHTS
4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER
4970-29093-0009 PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ASTOR LIBRARY PLANNED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS
4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP AND WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS
4970-29093-0006 LAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE ANTE ROOM OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE ATTENDANT FEES
4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATOR
4970-29093-0011 O VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE AND NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT
4970-29093-0007 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY OF FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHT FOOTED
2094-142345-0039 I'VE STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I'VE DONE
2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
2094-142345-0037 WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHEREVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORTS OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS US TO IT
2094-142345-0059 THIS MISSUS POYSER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANS AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
2094-142345-0043 BY THIS TIME THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE PALINGS AND HAD GOT DOWN FROM THEIR HORSES IT WAS PLAIN THEY MEANT TO COME IN
2094-142345-0028 NO NO NO TOTTY UD GET HER FEET WET SAID MISSUS POYSER CARRYING AWAY HER IRON
2094-142345-0048 SAID CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE SEATING HIMSELF WHERE HE COULD SEE ALONG THE SHORT PASSAGE TO THE OPEN DAIRY DOOR
2094-142345-0009 FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WHITTAW OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREDDLESTON GOSSIP
2094-142345-0049 NO SIR HE ISN'T HE'S GONE TO ROSSETER TO SEE MISTER WEST THE FACTOR ABOUT THE WOOL
2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND A LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
2094-142345-0030 TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG
2094-142345-0052 I MUST COME ANOTHER DAY AND SEE YOUR HUSBAND I WANT TO HAVE A CONSULTATION WITH HIM ABOUT HORSES
2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SURFACES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE RANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0051 NO THANK YOU I'LL JUST LOOK AT THE WHELPS AND LEAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT THEM WITH YOUR SHEPHERD
2094-142345-0021 THAT'S THE WAY WITH YOU THAT'S THE ROAD YOU'D ALL LIKE TO GO HEADLONGS TO RUIN
2094-142345-0033 WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I'VE FOUND IT SO
2094-142345-0038 I CAN NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TOTTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULDN'T REST WITHOUT RUNNING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
2094-142345-0036 NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS
2094-142345-0034 AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE AS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I'VE GOT LOTS O SHEETING AND TABLE CLOTHING AND TOWELLING AS ISN'T MADE UP
2094-142345-0056 I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
2094-142345-0057 I KNOW HIS FARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BEAT IT
2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME
2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH THE LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLACE
2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM
8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0000 HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBANS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR
8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0005 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG
8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE'S COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND
8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNERLOCHY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0017 HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS
8224-274381-0008 WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOLEMEN AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MERCHISTON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
8224-274381-0009 THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNERLOCHY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
8224-274381-0004 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCHO WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0012 MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0002 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0005 DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARDS IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON
8224-274381-0015 THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
8224-274381-0000 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS
5683-32879-0016 AND THE WAN ORACLE HAVING SPOKEN SHE SATE DOWN IN THE SAME SORT OF ABSTRACTION AGAIN BESIDE DORCAS AND SHE LOOKED FULL IN HER COUSIN'S EYES
5683-32879-0020 AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HER COUSIN'S NECK AND BRAVE RACHEL AT LAST BURST INTO TEARS
5683-32879-0014 YES SOMETHING EVERYTHING SAID RACHEL HURRIEDLY LOOKING FROWNINGLY AT A FLOWER WHICH SHE WAS TWIRLING IN HER FINGERS
5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALICE
5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMAN'S FARM
5683-32879-0018 IT IS AN ANTIPATHY AN ANTIPATHY I CANNOT GET OVER DEAR DORCAS YOU MAY THINK IT A MADNESS BUT DON'T BLAME ME
5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH
5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME
5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
5683-32879-0010 POOR RACHEL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
5683-32879-0013 CHELFORD HAD A NOTE FROM MISTER WYLDER THIS MORNING ANOTHER NOTE HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO IS ABROAD CONTINUED DORCAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
5683-32879-0017 OF MARK WYLDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISE ME SIMPLY THIS THAT YOU WILL NEVER ASK ME TO SPEAK AGAIN ABOUT HIM
5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND A SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
5683-32866-0009 I DON'T KNOW AND CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMEN DEFINE WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD CHELFORD AND WYLDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
5683-32866-0010 WELL YOU KNOW RADIE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BRACTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT
5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LAKE
5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES
5683-32865-0012 AND WYLDER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES ON LAKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING
5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LAKE WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHELFORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
5639-40744-0041 NOR WAS RODOLFO LESS SURPRISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL A FACT HE BEGGED LEOCADIA TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOUR HER HEAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED ESTAFANIA
5639-40744-0004 THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES IN THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE AUDACIOUS MEN
5639-40744-0005 FINALLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DESOLATION AND WOE
5639-40744-0030 JUST THEN LEOCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINED IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END LEOCADIA'S WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESSED DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONIES
5639-40744-0010 IT IS THE ONLY AMENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME
5639-40744-0028 I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SENOR SAID DONA ESTAFANIA TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THAT BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON
5639-40744-0020 THUS DID THIS HUMANE AND RIGHT MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE HER FEELINGS
5639-40744-0001 SECURE AS HE THOUGHT IN THE CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED INHABITANTS THE GOOD HIDALGO WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFAL HIS FAMILY
5639-40744-0016 ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY HER TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONA ESTAFANIA WHO AS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS AS NATURAL AS CRUELTY IS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHEDDING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LEOCADIA FROM HER SWOON
5639-40744-0037 KNOW THEN SON OF MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND THE PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENCE
5639-40744-0018 THAT WOULD BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING BUT NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY ITS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOCKED UP THERE
5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
5639-40744-0015 THIS PERSON WAS RODOLFO WHO THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT THEM WITH WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
5639-40744-0006 RODOLFO ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT AND LEOCADIA'S PARENTS REACHED THEIRS HEART BROKEN AND DESPAIRING
5639-40744-0025 THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SPOT
5639-40744-0023 WHEN THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSINGS UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEGOT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL
5639-40744-0017 CHOKING WITH EMOTION LEOCADI MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
5639-40744-0000 ELEVEN O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTERED LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAYING THE PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TOLEDANS IN THEIR VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON
5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS AND SILVER CANDLESTICKS
5639-40744-0034 ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER ENTRANCED WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WILL DISGUST ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
5639-40744-0039 WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN RODOLFO'S ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SENORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOUL
5639-40744-0019 WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDOING IT WILL DEIGN TO VINDICATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT
5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DESTINED PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
5639-40744-0002 RODOLFO AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER AND THE SERVANT MAID
5639-40744-0038 JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WERE MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR LEOCADIA GAVE SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS TO THE HEARTS OF ALL
5639-40744-0026 LUIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
5639-40744-0003 IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY HER OFF TO PLEASE RODOLFO FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARASITES READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO CONCEIVE THIS WICKED DESIGN TO COMMUNICATE IT APPROVE IT RESOLVE ON RAVISHING LEOCADIA AND TO CARRY THAT DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT
5639-40744-0014 AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOW
5639-40744-0012 SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOUR OF SOME DAMASK HANGINGS IN THE ROOM
5639-40744-0021 SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHUNNING EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CONCOURSE OF HORSEMEN
5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG HER ASSURANCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STROLL WITH RODOLFO THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ABDUCTION OF A GIRL WHOM RODOLFO CARRIED OFF WHILST THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD
5639-40744-0013 SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
1221-135767-0024 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANT A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICE WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONTISPIECE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0021 PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
1221-135767-0014 YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH
1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONOURED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0005 HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
4992-41806-0000 NATTY HARMON TRIED THE KITCHEN PUMP SECRETLY SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE EVENING FOR THE WATER HAD TO RUN UP HILL ALL THE WAY FROM THE WELL TO THE KITCHEN SINK AND HE BELIEVED THIS TO BE A CONTINUAL MIRACLE THAT MIGHT GIVE OUT AT ANY MOMENT
4992-41806-0012 AT THAT MOMENT THE GENTLEMAN ENTERED BEARING A HUGE OBJECT CONCEALED BY A PIECE OF GREEN FELT
4992-41806-0008 OLIVE HAS ANOTHER LOVELY GIFT FOR THE YELLOW HOUSE SAID MOTHER CAREY RISING AND TO CARRY OUT THE NEXT PART OF THE PROGRAMME WE SHALL HAVE TO GO IN PROCESSION UPSTAIRS TO MY BEDROOM
4992-41806-0013 APPROACHING THE DINING TABLE HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE ARTICLE IN THE CENTRE AND REMOVED THE CLOTH
4992-41806-0017 WE SHUT OUR EYES THE FLOWERS BLOOM ON WE MURMUR BUT THE CORN EARS FILL WE CHOOSE THE SHADOW BUT THE SUN THAT CASTS IT SHINES BEHIND US STILL
4992-41806-0003 KATHLEEN WAVED THE TORCH TO AND FRO AS SHE RECITED SOME BEAUTIFUL LINES WRITTEN FOR SOME SUCH PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH CALLED THEM TOGETHER TO NIGHT
4992-41806-0015 MISSUS HARMON THOUGHT HE SANG TOO MUCH AND TOLD HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY THAT IF HE WAS A CANARY BIRD SHE SHOULD WANT TO KEEP A TABLE COVER OVER HIS HEAD MOST OF THE TIME BUT HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH THE REST OF HIS AUDIENCE
4992-41806-0006 RALPH THURSTON HAD FOUND A LINE OF LATIN FOR THEM IN HIS BELOVED HORACE TIBI SPLENDET FOCUS FOR YOU THE HEARTH FIRE SHINES
4992-41806-0011 MOTHER CAREY POURED COFFEE NANCY CHOCOLATE AND THE OTHERS HELPED SERVE THE SANDWICHES AND CAKE DOUGHNUTS AND TARTS
4992-41806-0016 THE FACE OF THE MAHOGANY SHONE WITH DELIGHT AND WHY NOT WHEN IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING ALMOST EVERYTHING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A PIANO AND YET THE FAMILY HAD ENJOYED WEEKS OF GOOD NOURISHING MEALS ON WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED BY ITS EXERTIONS
4992-41806-0001 TO NIGHT THERE WAS NO NEED OF EXTRA HEAT AND THERE WERE GREAT CEREMONIES TO BE OBSERVED IN LIGHTING THE FIRES ON THE HEARTHSTONES
4992-41806-0002 THEY BEGAN WITH THE ONE IN THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM COLONEL WHEELER RALPH THURSTON MISTER AND MISSUS BILL HARMON WITH NATTY AND RUFUS MISTER AND MISSUS POPHAM WITH DIGBY AND LALLIE JOY ALL STANDING IN ADMIRING GROUPS AND THRILLING WITH DELIGHT AT THE ORDER OF EVENTS
4992-41806-0014 THINKS I TO MYSELF I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OSH POPHAM COULDN'T MEND IF HE TOOK TIME ENOUGH AND GLUE ENOUGH SO I CARRIED THIS LITTLE FELLER HOME IN A BUSHEL BASKET ONE NIGHT LAST MONTH AN I'VE SPENT ELEVEN EVENIN'S PUTTIN HIM TOGETHER
4992-41806-0007 OLIVE HAD PAINTED THE MOTTO ON A LONG NARROW PANEL OF CANVAS AND GIVING IT TO MISTER POPHAM STOOD BY THE FIRESIDE WHILE HE DEFTLY FITTED IT INTO THE PLACE PREPARED FOR IT
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILNER'S ELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT MINE
4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILNER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT TOO REFINED
4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
4992-23283-0005 NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED AND YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE WRONG
4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MILITATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
4992-23283-0009 OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WITH A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR ENTRUSTING
4992-23283-0012 INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNE SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS A VIVACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITHAL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOUR THAT MIGHT ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
4992-41797-0009 HENRY LORD WITH THE DEGREE OF PH D TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS
4992-41797-0001 WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS INTO JAIL AND THE MURDERERS AND THE WIFE BEATERS I'VE ALLERS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF WOULD BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE BEATER CAUSE HE PROBABLY HAS A LOT O PROVOCATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE FIREBUGS CAN'T THINK O THE RIGHT NAME SOMETHING LIKE CENDENARIES AN THE BREAKERS O THE PEACE AN WHAT NOT AN YET THE LAW HAS NOTHIN TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HEN LORD
4992-41797-0013 SHE MAKES EFFORT AFTER EFFORT TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS AND WHEN SHE FAILS TO REPRODUCE WHAT SHE SEES SHE WORKS HERSELF INTO A FRENZY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT
4992-41797-0015 CYRIL THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER WAY OF DOING I JUST DRAW THE OUTLINE OF AN ANIMAL AND THEN I PUT HAIRS OR FEATHERS ON IT THEY HAVE NO BODIES
4992-41797-0018 THERE IN THE CEDAR HOLLOW THEN LIVED OLIVE LORD AN ANGRY RESENTFUL LITTLE CREATURE WEIGHED DOWN BY A FIERCE SENSE OF INJURY
4992-41797-0020 NANCY'S CURLY CHESTNUT CROP SHONE IN THE SUN AND OLIVE'S THICK BLACK PLAITS LOOKED BLACKER BY CONTRAST
4992-41797-0007 HE GIVE UP HIS POSITION AND SHUT THE FAMILY UP IN THAT TOMB OF A HOUSE SO T HE COULD STUDY HIS BOOKS
4992-41797-0014 WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
4992-41797-0017 HE WOULDN'T SEARCH SO DON'T WORRY REPLIED CYRIL QUIETLY AND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT IT WAS SO
4992-41797-0022 SHE'S OLDER THAN I AM BUT SO TINY AND SAD AND SHY THAT SHE SEEMS LIKE A CHILD
4992-41797-0021 SHE'S WONDERFUL MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANYBODY WE'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE AND SHE DRAWS BETTER THAN THE TEACHER IN CHARLESTOWN
4992-41797-0008 MISTER POPHAM EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSAID IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS
4992-41797-0004 I SWAN TO MAN HE EJACULATED IF YOU DON'T WORK HARD YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES DOCTOR OF LAWS
1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0005 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST ALLUVION
1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0010 SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122617-0026 WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0031 BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
1320-122617-0032 KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS IN AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0023 UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HINT HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSED OF COOKERY
1320-122617-0039 THE MOHICAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0003 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED HAWKEYE UNCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0035 THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIOUS HAWKEYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0012 FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0011 THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTER OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0024 BUT HAWKEYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BALAAM'S ASS TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0019 UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHES
1320-122617-0033 IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
1320-122617-0028 MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THIS SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0025 SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0029 IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON COMPOSSER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED CONJURER TO ENTER
1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKEYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
1320-122617-0034 HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
7176-92135-0042 IN NOVELS THE HERO HAS OFTEN PUSHED HIS MEALS AWAY UNTASTED BUT NO STAGE HERO WOULD DO ANYTHING SO UNNATURAL AS THIS
7176-92135-0040 HOSTESS REPLACES LUMP AND INCLINES EMPTY TEAPOT OVER TRAY FOR A MOMENT THEN HANDS HIM A CUP PAINTED BROWN INSIDE THUS DECEIVING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE IN THE UPPER CIRCLE
7176-92135-0005 BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
7176-92135-0018 IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
7176-92135-0014 IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
7176-92135-0006 I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0022 TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER TIS NOBLER IN THE MIND TO SUFFER THE SLINGS AND ARROWS WHAT NO HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0025 IT IS TO LET HAMLET IF THAT HAPPEN TO BE THE NAME OF YOUR CHARACTER ENTER WITH A SMALL DOG PET FALCON MONGOOSE TAME BEAR OR WHATEVER ANIMAL IS MOST IN KEEPING WITH THE PART AND CONFIDE IN THIS ANIMAL SUCH SORROWS HOPES OR SECRET HISTORY AS THE AUDIENCE HAS GOT TO KNOW
7176-92135-0015 AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT
7176-92135-0012 INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING
7176-92135-0000 HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS
7176-92135-0008 LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGECRAFT IS
7176-92135-0001 IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
7176-92135-0031 AND THERE YOU ARE YOU WILL OF COURSE APPRECIATE THAT THE UNFINISHED SENTENCES NOT ONLY SAVE TIME BUT ALSO MAKE THE MANOEUVRING VERY MUCH MORE NATURAL
7176-92135-0023 YOU GAVE ME DOUBLE FIVE I WANT DOUBLE NINE HALLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0038 A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES HAWTREY OR OWEN NARES ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
7176-92135-0020 DOUBLE NINE TWO THREE ELSINORE DOUBLE NINE YES HALLO IS THAT YOU HORATIO HAMLET SPEAKING
7176-92135-0036 THE CROWD DRIFTS OFF LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN
7176-92135-0044 BUT IT IS THE CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION
7176-92135-0016 THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
7176-92135-0017 IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
7176-88083-0007 BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
7176-88083-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0004 BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0011 IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0018 BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0001 THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD
7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0000 ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES
5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVADAC BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
5105-28233-0007 BEN ZOOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVADAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVADAC
5105-28233-0002 IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER
5105-28233-0010 UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPER'S TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END
5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEN ZOOF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACHT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
5105-28241-0017 AFTER PONDERING AWHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
5105-28241-0018 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
5105-28241-0008 THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT INCURRING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ONTO THE SUN
5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATER
5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARDS THE NORTH
5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE ALGERIAN METROPOLIS
5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLES SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED
5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRYNA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOR OF FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND
5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BEN ZOOF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
5105-28240-0019 MY YACHT IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD
5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOPMASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER
5105-28240-0009 SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAINSAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOPSAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIB
5105-28240-0000 FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVADAC HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD ENSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FATALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL
5105-28240-0005 HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE
5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DOBRYNA SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPEFIED THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS
2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
2830-3980-0057 THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2830-3980-0031 WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0008 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROERER PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TODAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO
2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGNED THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMALLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KIRTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS ATTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW AN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH
4077-13751-0007 THE BOOK OF MORMON HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS DARK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THE RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISSOURI WITH GOVERNOR BOGGS AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALDWELL COUNTY THEREIN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTED SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WARDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTHOOD ORGANIZATIONS
4077-13751-0020 AS A SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISSOURIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SUN NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELYTING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTISE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELYTES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOL BOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBIGENSES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE VAUDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN AND ARMS FOR THEIR COUNTRY'S NEED
4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTIAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTISE BUT OF CELESTIAL MARRIAGE PLURALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT MORMONS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY
4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINALE HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MEET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCES OF MANY YEARS DURATION
4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST
4077-13754-0009 AT THE INCEPTION OF PLURAL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTISE
4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ESCHEATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PLURAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRIOR TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER
4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHAT GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS
8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY
8230-279154-0028 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0000 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
8230-279154-0026 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
8230-279154-0002 WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT IS HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0001 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0027 A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL TENABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIOURIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOURIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
8230-279154-0040 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0030 SEMON'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
8230-279154-0038 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
